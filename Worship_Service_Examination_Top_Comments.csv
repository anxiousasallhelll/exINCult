What caught my attention though was the activity on april 27-28 (?). It‚Äôs for a special offering and the minister said something along the lines of ‚Äúoffer the kind of amount that you‚Äôve never offered before‚Äù Must be for EVM and his entourage and for all the lawsuits the church is facing. The minister repeatedly said to save up for it, so ‚ÄúGod‚Äù will be pleased. We‚Äôre really buying our way to heaven yeah?

The minister also said something about being united in everything, especially during the upcoming elections. That we should be non-partisan. Psh. Check articles about duterte, you‚Äôll find trash, duterte fanatics‚Äô comments there. Click their profile and most of the time you‚Äôll see on their bio, ‚Äúproud to be INC‚Äù lol.

Our minister talked about liars not making it to heaven. You know who‚Äôs definitely NOT going to heaven then? EVM and all his cohorts.

He also kept referencing things EVM said during the International Officer‚Äôs Day. Maybe he was doing it to guilt trip those who didn‚Äôt attend, but all it did was remind me how lucky I was to have dodged that waste of time bullet. 

I got an eyelash in my eye towards the end of the sermon and I was rubbing my eyes trying to get it out. I guess our minister thought I was feeling the Holy Spirit bc he looked directly at me as he talked about praying our hardships away. üôÑ",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/bblvt0/midweek_worship_service_examination_apr_10_apr_11/
"Mid-week worship service examination (Apr 10 - Apr 11, 2019)",bblvt0,2019-04-10,"Lesson this week was about uphold fervour till the end; how God will will help us throughout our harsh life.

At the beginning there were mentions of, don‚Äôt be inactive nor be separated from our divine elections and how today‚Äôs sermon will be about how to hold our ground during hardship.

Verses I heard (this is my first time writing these down so I might be wrong, it‚Äôs been years since my last Relgious Study class when I went to a catholic high school where they taught us how to read the bible, not even by the Church of Christ lol)

**Psalms 65, ?-19** (I missed the first one, I was so nervous making notes at first lol)
‚ÄúPay attention, creation of heaven and earth... no more cries or anguish.‚Äù
Told that we should look forward to the joys and promises made by God as he has created a new heaven and earth ‚Äî> the holy city. Therefore, all the BS we facing rn, ignore the ‚Äúgravity‚Äù of this world as it‚Äôs a distraction. ~~guess I‚Äôm gonna float to space~~ Focus on the new city.

Who will receive the blessings?
**Revelations, Ch 14, 30:** ‚Äúblessed are this who die Christian.‚Äù Being a member of the COC, we will be saved ~~allegedly~~ 
More postulation about having no more toils and labours in the New City. 

True Christian, what is that?
**John, 1-4:** ‚ÄúI am a Christian... don‚Äôt do what have been told then they‚Äôre a liar.‚Äù Links to the commandment (?) and that member shouldn‚Äôt be liars lol 

Door of sheepfold 
**John, Ch 10, 7, 9:** ‚ÄúCome in me...‚Äù 
only way we can be saved is going to the COC. We should relinquish our faith and be proud to be a member as membership is important to be saved.
Links to **Acts 20:28** (lamsa rendition) about Jesus being head self and is the flock = COC.
Statements made in motivating to be active, links to works of propagation

Who will be in heaven in the church?
**Thessalonians, Chapter (Ch) 1, 4 & 5:** ‚Äúdetermined in the faith even during hard times... fit for the kingdom‚Äù
The troubles that we are facing makes it so that we are fit for the kingdom. Minster goes on by saying that our membership isn‚Äôt enough and we must have *steadfast and deterministic characteristics* in the midsts of suffering ‚Äî this is what makes us genuine Christians and member of the Church of Christ (COC)

What other characteristics should we have? ~~aside from corruption, manipulation and egotistical~~
**Psalms 37, 3-6:** ‚ÄúTrust the Lord... given hearts desire... let Him lead you.‚Äù Links were made to completely believe in God and that we should completely obey teachings and commandments.
Made links to upholding: attendance, sharing our faith, loving brothers and sisters in the faith, *even loving our enemies and offering.*
Mentions of church administrators in intensifying propagation and ***we should do our part by sharing the Pasugo, INC media website, INC cards etc.***

Stop serving due to troubles? No. 
**Romans 8, Ch 35, 38, 39:** ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt he love us anymore, has God deserted us?‚Äù
Being in the COC, we are ready to face death and it will not separate our love with  God. **Neither will hell or fear wouldn‚Äôt remove the love God has for us,** just like how Jesus dying for the COC to be redeemed ‚Äî this is the type of conviction we need as a member of the COC.
Jesus dying ‚Äî> Acquitted us from eternal judgement.
***Will you let a job, friends, relationships outside the COC jeopardise your salvation?*** We must ignore these to be saved.

Conviction, now, what else? 
**Philippians 4, 12-14:** ‚ÄúLive next to nothing, content, in any situation.‚Äù ~~I would like to give this passage specifically for Ka Eddie boy.~~
Due to the power given to us by Jesus; holy sprit receive during the worship service, we shouldn‚Äôt forsake our attendance or else we don‚Äôt get the power. Classic link to the *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt extinguish the Holy Spirit‚Äù*
He‚Äôll be back for salvation if we uphold our election and membership (assurance)

But I‚Äôm in pain, how to ease the burden?
**Peter 5-7:** ‚Äúcast whole completely, our anxiety and concern on Him.‚Äù
God cares for you, take advantage of this and draw near to him. Open your heart, do your part as He is willing to grant blessings to us 
Sustain the family, spiritual blessing and guidance, *no one will be removed or tested from the COC in Gods return.*

Special offering this weekend, so I guess I‚Äôm still giving the same amount (the minimal amount lol)",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/bblvt0/midweek_worship_service_examination_apr_10_apr_11/
"Mid-week worship service examination (Apr 10 - Apr 11, 2019)",bblvt0,2019-04-10,"To summarize it up, it's about serving God or in INC's case, the INC Administration, that not even death can separate you from Him/Them. Because why will you leave if God has a special place reserved for you in heaven? Also, if your family does not like you going to INC, leave them too because not even them can stop you.

Not only that, they specifically said that saying you're a Christian is not enough as everyone can lie that they'll be they're the chosen one so you really need to be IN the INC to be saved. So everyone from the outside?

Yeah, they'll be punished FOREVER for something they've done TEMPORARY.

If this is not more than enough explanation for everyone to see that this is a big CULT sign, then I don't know what else to explain.

Third, so you compared him to a minister. Alright then, where are the people YOU invited to listen to yourself speak? What's your excuse for not inviting? What you're insinuating is that regular members are more responsible than ministers. Regular members have full-time jobs, sometimes as much as 2 to 3. You have one job, as a minister.

# Sermon

**Theme:** Prepare your ~~wasted money~~ Thanksgiving offering that you have set aside for the entire year!

**Verses:** (personal comments in *italics*)

* **2 Corinthians 9:5** \- Reason why you should set aside. *""As a generous gift and not forced to do"" yet we feel forced due to fearmongering.*
* **2 Corinthians 9:7** \- ""Give it cheerily"" because God loves cheery things. *Although, we cannot do this if we are trapped in the cult.*
* **2 Corinthians 9:2** \- Thanksgiving is not a new thing.
* **2 Corinthians 8:1** \- ""The grace of God bestows upon them on the churches of Macedonia"" meaning that you'll be graced if you give your ""voluntary"" offerings.
* **2 Corinthians 8:2** \- Give money even if you are poor.
* **2 Corinthians 8:3** \- ""As much as they could, more than they could in their free will"". *The KJV translation says ""For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;"", but the minister almost never always says the translations used, unless if multiple are used.*
* **2 Corinthians 8:4** \- They weren't forced, apparently... *I can recall this verse having ""They begged us"", but KJV says otherwise. Then again, there's LOTS of English translations for the Bible.*
* **2 Corinthians 8:5** (first part) - ""It was more than expected"", probably telling us to give more than just the TC card but the offerings we set aside for the year.
* **2 Corinthians 8:5** (second part) - ""They gave themselves to the Lord"" - and trust the Administration. *No idea why they had to split one verse into two parts. Probably for clarification.*
* **Hebrews 13:16** \- Reason why we shouldn't be offended, so God can be well pleased.
* **Songs 15:23** \- Thank God (?). *The person next to me stared at me and I tried to act like l wasn't writing shit in the first place...*
* **Proverbs 3:9-10** \- Honor the lord with your possessions. You shouldn't offer only when you have excess, etc. Minister also added that the blessings are only reserved for those who offer. *The minister decided to speak a bit of Tagalog in the English WS. Wtf?*
* **Malachi ?:9-10** \- Revenge for those who question His blessings. ""We should give offerings wholeheartedly and obey His commandments so He is pleased!"" *Malachi only has 4 chapters, but I was a bit distracted so I heard ""9-10"" only.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/e3qfm7/weekend_worship_service_examination_nov_30_dec_01/

"Mid-week worship service examination (Dec 18 - Dec 19, 2019)",ecceqc,2019-12-18,"Introduction: World is in poverty and is majorly caused by laziness of people. 

2 Thessalonians 3:10  
**NIV:** ""For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: 'The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat."" 

**Those who are lazy are not going to inherit salvation according to the law of God.** 

Genesis 3:17  
**NIV:** ""To Adam he said, ""Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat from it,'   
**""Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life.""** 

  
\- (I don't get where the laziness plays a part from this verse?) I guess the point they're trying to make here is that being 'fruitful' is a commandment of God. To defy this commandment is to become lazy and therefore, God will curse you if you disobey. 

**How does laziness affect livelihood?**

Proverbs 4:10  
**NIV:** ""Listen, my son, accept what I say, and the years of your life will be many.""

\- (Again, without the title of 'laziness and poverty' this verse is so vague) They're probably trying to say that if you obey the commandment of God by being diligent and fruitful when it comes to works, then you will reap what you sow; blessed by many years to your life(?). 

**What are the habits of lazy people?**

Proverbs 6:9-10   
**NIV:** ""How long will you lie there, you sluggard? When will you get up from your sleep?""   
""A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest - "" 

\- So their point here is, lazy people love to sleep. To be honest, that's like a really general description of lazy people. Sleeping isn't just because you are lazy, some people actually have issues, but I guess INC doesn't believe in those issues. 

**Why shouldn't we be lazy?** 

Ephesians 4:28   
**NIV:** ""Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share to those in need."" 

\- Is this implying that lazy people are thieves and therefore we should not be lazy? What?  
\- It also implied that father's of each household should provide for their families because they also have needs. I personally dislike how the minister delivered this; 

1.) Families should work together, by pinning all the responsibilities on the father is just wrong. 

2.) He also subtly underpinned women as 'inferior' by saying submit to your husbands and take care of the children. While it isn't wrong to take care of children, why did he only mention mothers? Fathers play an important role in raising up children too ya know. 

**(I didn't write down the question for further verses)** 

Ecclesiastes 9:10  
**NIV:** ""Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom."" 

\- I think the question is along the lines of; ""Why should we be hardworking?""   
\- Minister also points out that we should not turn down opportunities in jobs and in school. Talk about irony in here. Any opportunities in places without a worship service is visibly looked down upon, hah! caught you INC! 

Ephesians 6:6-7  
**NIV:** ""Obey them not only to win their favour when their eye is on you, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart. Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people,"" 

\- I dislike the word 'slave' because no one is. No one deserves to be shackled by some sort of belief. So, even though the owner or your boss is not watching, you should work 100%.   
\- The question is along the lines of; ""Why must we work diligently even when the master is not watching?"" 

Proverbs 4:5-6  
**NIV:** ""Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or turn away from them.""  
""Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will watch over you.""

\- This verse was used to say that God utilises the Church Administration for us to be informed of God's commandment. (Can anyone tell me the connection of the Church Administration to this verse? lol) 

**(I remember the question!) - What is God telling the Rich people?**

Deuteronomy 8:12-14  
**NIV:** ""Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses and settle down,""  
""and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied,""  
""then your heart will become proud and you will forget the LORD YOUR GOD, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery."" 

\- Basically, it's saying that if you become rich, your heart will be clouded by greed and power and will forget your Lord Almighty who gave you everything.   
\- It is also emphasised that if God gave you abundant blessings in life, then he can easily take it away if he deems you unworthy anymore. (talk about always having to please someone from above lmao) 

Proverbs 30:7-9  
**NIV:** ""Two things I ask of you, Lord; do not reuse me before I die:""  
""Keep falsehood and lies far from me; give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread.""  
""Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you and say, 'Who is the Lord?' Or I may become poor and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God.

\- Minister points out, maybe the reason why our prayers of getting abundant blessings isn't answered is because God knows what will turn out of us if we become rich(????????????? Like tf??????) So we should learn how to be contented. 

**My thoughts on this;**   
If being rich is based on hard work, then  the farmers and other jobs considered to be for untouchables, shouldn't they be rich by now? 

And if the things we ask are only enough for our needs, then why tf do we have so many donations in the church? 

Please stop the gender discrimination!

Farmers in my country make less than $5 a month, luckily sometimes they earn $10 a month even if they are a family of +8 members. The garbage ppl too, they wake up from their garbage houses to search valuable stuff and sell it to survive. I'm not even kidding.

Later I saw the members sitting near me who work hard, have family but are still getting less than the minimun salary.

Are they calling them lazy? Or is it for us? Where the labor demmand is getting really hard because this is a competitive era? We live in a different decade, it was easy before.

This lesson also generalize a lot and is just an excuse to overwork members and blame the unemployed ppl, younger ones because they don't work. I again will reapeat this, they don't even care about the situation of a country.

**Opening Remarks:** Oh noes, the world is poor, so they blame different things like wars. Oh, #1 reason why they're poor? Laziness. *this is true to an extent IMO wow*

**Sermon:** *Personal notes are in italics.*

* **2 Thessalonians 3:10** \- Are you lazy? Then YOU DO NOT DESERVE FOOD! *Welcome to the Promised Land, if you don't work, this is gulag.*
* **Genesis 3:17** \- The first law people violated.
* **Proverbs 10:4** \- Poor works with idle hands, hand of the diligent makes him rich. *Atleast that makes sense.*
* **Ephesians 4:28** \- Thief who is now a believer should be a hardworking man now. *Lazy people are thieves. But that's just a theory. A CULT THEORY.*
* **Ecclesiastes 9:10** **^(Good News Translation)** ***^(GNT)*** \- Work hard because there's gonna be nothing when you die which are you destined to be.
* **Ephesians 6:7** \- Do work cheerily just like you serve the Lord and not human beings. God is watching. *The minister began to talk about debts (utang) and said we cry over them...when y'all really cry over prayers lol.*
* **Somewhere in Proverbs (Minister did not disclose specific chapter and verse)** \- *Minister assumed that the first thing we do is to check the salary like it's a bad thing. Don't we do that to give our family a good life, but most importantly, for your cult members to give lots of cash to EVM? Minister then shits out assumptions that we are so tired from work that we sleep in WS to compensate. Then shat out a generalization: ""The lazy always has food in their minds, always wants high quality food, expert in sleep, their job is sleep."" Bitch, laziness =/= wanting to sleep 24/7 and just eat. They could be active in different things, you fucking dumbass wanker in a suit. Sorry for the harsh language lol.*

At first, I was surprised and thought that the minister was going to disagree and criticize the bill. 

Turns out he only used that as an segue into the lesson, that the bill shows how the youth of today is becoming more and more evil. Instead of you know, how ridiculous that bill of law is.

But the topic of our sermon is about the world is going down to shits. Pretty much how the minister describe what is going on currently. Then he went on and say this is foretold in the bible a very long time. And that no gov't or institution can stop it. Reading Ezekiel 7:5; Jeremiah 4:20; and other ""I will put the fear in you"" verses in the bible. All pointing to the end of the world is very near (something we surely have heard since we were young ones). 

So what should we do?  Pray to the Lord. - establish a devotional prayer. be prayerful. **Pray without a doubt** in your heart that what you asked for is to be granted. - lots of verses Psalms, II Chronicles, Hebrews... all from the old testament where the people are stubborn as hell and the God is a vindictive, angry and moody one;

\-- Wait a minute, if I have no doubt that god will grant my prayer, why do I keep repeating it again and again? or to the point of having to make a devotional prayer? isn't that a sign of doubting? I mean once should be enough right? God is not deaf according to Matthew 6:7-8  **7**¬†‚ÄúAnd when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. **8**¬†Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.  . ... . -- Pretty much Jesus telling it how it should be done..

What else? Glorify his name --> do not miss a worshit service; where in every prayer they ask for God to spare EVM from all the bad things going on around. Every. prayer. Like the first one is not enough, we need a second and a third just in case God was not paying attention the first time.

 What else? Do not sin. Oh btw there are 2 categories of sinning in the INC. one is the traditional sins (adultery, stealing,murder, etc. etc) which applies to everyone.

The second one is, NOT doing the good thing is also sinning! hah! This is exclusive to INC members only! and what are the good thing? Worship service, joining in the propagation activities, and of course giving your offering. Not only on the traditional offering but the special offering for the locale, the district, the aid to humanity, the yearly thanksgiving... so if you miss any of this. You sir or madam is a sinner so better increase your offering next time to atone for this.

It ended by reading a verse on Matthew chapter 4: stitching verse 6 and 19

 **6**¬†do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.  **19**¬†And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 

There you go. Prosperity Gospel at its finest. He interpreted to abound in thanksgiving and God will not only protect you but will reward you with all riches and blessing.

So, I like the way how this religion and the other religions focuses on the Weaknesses of is being Human. That we can't do anything without God's help, and that way is through the Church. 

Also, when is Christ Gonna come. Another reminder. ""Christ is coming soon! Are you keeping the faith?"" 

We've been told this for what? 106 years. 
A promise of a heavenly reward. Remember all this is based off the Bible. The Bible that replaced the word, ""Pedophile"" with the word, ""Homosexual"" in 1946. 

Okay. So now we're talking about the EVM. 

Or the Evangelical Mission. He's asking. 

""Did you invite? Did you even attend?""

No, ""brother"" I didn't attend, But I did invite. I share the Incmedia website on my massive Twitter account with my friends in the DMs. 

They all think the same thing. 

""Bruh, you're in a cult.""

Yes, thank you for this site. Thank you for your exclusive doctrine. The church will NOT win. Not against knowledge and education. 

Here we go again. Talking about the Spanish Flu. Talking about, ""all these other Christians are running by you, are you running your race!?""

Clearly to make me feel bad. Comparing myself against others. Now we're talking about, ""remember when  out father was back in the ""HomeLand"" ""

Sorry, I'm not Filipino. I'm American. 

""Remember before when we were outside of the church!? ""

Actually bruh, I don't. I was born in the Church.. so was my family. I don't know anything but this. 

It's easy for you right brother? Being a minister, taking our money. The view point of how the current working economy works is so dated. Do you not understand how the world works? 

Like JFC bro, listen to yourself. Brethren like me, listen. Imagine as if you weren't a member, or imagine a different church saying and doing these things. What would you think?

The lesson was teaching that god's (evm) knowledge is better that human-acquired knowledge. From what i understood frm the lesson, they say that it's good to study and learn at school, but it's worthless without god's own knowledge.


And i felt that there's a subliminal message that encourages students to study in NEU despite the cost of tuition fees (striving to learn even though it is expensive). And also hints of obeying the usual activities like evangelical missions and giving offerings.

I saw that this lesson was made by glicerio santos jr. Apologies if there are hints of bitterness and sarcasm.

As they announced before the sermon, Dalao is a city in the Philippines, where the INC sought to establish their locale way back in 1949. As of somewhere around 2019, the locale now has a fully built chapel. I may have missed some details, we could assume this to be a case of negligence for a locale to be incomplete for almost 70 years, but correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.

One thing that stood out in the sermon was the topic of how us ever-so-loyal members of the Church should be happy in these ‚Äútimes of trials‚Äù, as was instructed by I believe was Apostle Peter in the verse I Peter 4:12. EVM also takes a doctrine that compares the members enduring these trials to ‚Äúone-third of humanity being put in the fire to turn into silver‚Äù. Yeah, I guess quarantine is supposed to encourage us to improve as people, amirite?

I also want to point out that EVM has also talked about how we INC members don‚Äôt take drugs, alcohol, or gambling like the ‚Äúother people of this world do‚Äù. So I guess he‚Äôs generalizing that to every single non-INC? Okay then.

There, I said as much as I could find to be accurate to the WebEx. Now, I do NOT remember EVM comparing (or belittling) human knowledge to Godly knowledge, so if he actually did that, then please elaborate and fill in those blanks for me. I know he DEFINITELY did not talk about a new mission in Africa. The Africa campaign has gone down a bit in INC media, and I don‚Äôt remember seeing it on our Evangelical Mission video presentations anymore. Again, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.

For such a community that has helped young members like me open my eyes to the truth‚Äîif you aren‚Äôt gonna bother paying attention to the one guy that may be behind it all, then maybe slathering your snark around so proudly just isn‚Äôt a good idea. Some of the comments here are slightly misleading at best and a downright joke at worst.

Hymn lineup specifically centered on hymns with WS-centered lyrics, especially hymn 279 (which I'll admit I like due to the melody), which was a hint about the sermon.

Anyway, sermon starts off with the ""people are becoming faithless"" tied with the ""life's hard"" opening.  Then it goes on to how WS can solve problems; it then segues into how members shouldn't forsake WS because members won't get blessings and salvation. EVM is referred to in how he's 'beseeching' church members to devote themselves to the church. Sermon continues by citing John 4:23 and says how God doesn't value worship from those outside the INC; this theme is repeated throughout the sermon. Psalm 4:1-2 is cited for how true worshippers are never absent from WS, while Romans 12:1 is referred to for the ""living holy sacrifices"" point. At this point, they make a point of how it's not enough to just show up for WS; meanwhile 1 Thessalonians 2:13 is cited. Then it goes into a segment where the minister tells the congregation to be more active in church activities and mentions an upcoming WebEx led by ""EVM's primary helpers in the church administration"". Anyway they give reasoning for joining in: to ""please God"" (again with living sacrifices) and that it's ""God's will"". Hebrews 9:14 and Acts 20:28 (shocker) are cited as why the INC is the only church that God accepts worship and service from. More imploring about how members should invite people to hear the word and send INC links. Hebrews 10:25 is cited and then the minister talks about how this isn't surprising because ""they don't have the right to worship God anyway"". More on EVM as he is quoted in how members should guard their faith and how he admonishes members to dedicate themselves to the church. Some verse in Hebrews is used to say how those outside of the church should expect ""fearful judgment"" and how willful neglect of WS will result in being burned in hell. ""INC is the true church and you all have the right to serve and worship God"" is repeated again. 2 Chronicles 6:8 is cited to show Israel is no longer God's chosen nation, and for more proof on how forsaking WS will result in bad things. Then the minister gets ""emotional"" and goes back to our problems and then goes on a string of pleadings that each start off with ""may you"". Psalms 6:2-4 and 145:18-19 are read, both readings were done with the voice that tries to sound emotional. After that, another round of pleadings and pledges in a ""emotional"" voice by the minister, such as ""let us not forsake the WS"" and ""let us become more zealous in church activities"" (the latter is quoted word-for-word). The INC anthem 'I Am a Member of the Church of Christ' plays. The prayer afterward is always the same with the questionable emotion. No mention of the pandemic anywhere throughout the prayer. Pleadings for EVM and his helpers to be blessed to they may ""lead"" the members. At least a request for blessed livelihoods is given near the end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/ii0tdd/weekend_worship_service_examination_aug_28_aug_31/

BY BROTHER ANTONIO T. de GUZMAN JR.
WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY: SEPTEMBER 16/17, 2020


THE ONE WHOM GOD WILL SURELY HAVE MERCY ON, PROTECT, AND SAVE IN TIMES OF TROUBLE
We thank God for placing an Administration in the Church of Christ foreach of us tobe edified in faith and to reach perfection. Through the words of God written in the Bible, Brother Eduardo Manalo, our Executive Minister, has instructed us not to give up but, instead, to continue trusting in God. He wants us to understand that it is God Who can truly help us because nothing is impossible with Him. 
For us to surmount all the difficulties that we face today, the Executive Minister exhorts us to include in our prayers to God what is written in Isaiah 33:2(Good News Bible): ‚ÄúLORD, have mercy on us. We have put our hope in You. Protect us day by day and save us in times of trouble.‚Äù 
Those who put their hope in God who are certain of receiving His mercy are God‚Äôs people, according to First Peter 2:9-10 (Amplified Version). God chose them or gave them the divine election when they were redeemed. Hence, no one can just claim to be a chosen of God because one needs to be counted among those redeemed. 
According to Apostle Paul in Romans5:8-9 (AMP), Christ‚Äôs blood was used to redeem the chosen ones of God to be His people. That clearly shows God‚Äôs love and mercy for them. They are now justified, acquitted, made righteous, and brought into right relationship with God. Hence, they are certain of salvation.
It is proven in Acts 20:28 (LamsaTranslation) that the Church redeemed by Christ‚Äôs blood is the Church Of Christ. Therefore, we are sure that we are the ones whom God will have mercy on, protect, and save in times of trouble. Most of all, we will certainly be saved from the greatest destruction‚ÄîJudgment Day. We are very blessed. Hence, let us always cherish our divine election. 
However, it is not enough that we are just members of the Church Of Christ or counted in God‚Äôs nation for Him to protect us day by day. 
According to Psalm37:23-24 (Good News Bible), we should also do the things that please Him day by day. We will be able to do that if we do what King Hezekiahdid.  According to Second Chronicles 31:20-21 (EasyEnglish Bible), Hezekiah did what was good and right‚ÄîGod‚Äôs law and rules. He was determined to obey. And, in doing so,he did not lose out because the Bible says, ‚ÄúSo very good things happened to him.‚Äù God saved him from his enemies and helped him defeat them. God healed him from a deadly disease and added 15 years to his life. 
Thus, what many Church members are doing is right. They are determined to obey. They do not allow themselves to be hindered from obeying God. Despite the pandemic, they continue to conduct worship services to God, give offerings, uphold the love of the brotherhood, share the faith, and submit to the Church Administration. They also take advantage of the opportunity to strengthen the relationship of every member of the household and their relationship with God through fervent prayers. Obedience is the most effective‚Äú personal protective equipment‚Äù because the obedient is the one whom God will protect day by day. 
For us to be sure that God will save us in times of trouble, we must be consistently righteous. As stated in Psalm37:39 (AMP), ‚ÄúThe salvation of the [consistently]righteous is of the Lord.‚Äù Being consistent means not being seasonal or changing depending on the circumstance.
For us to be consistently righteous no matter what our circumstance in life is, let us imitate our Lord Jesus Christ. As stated in First Peter 2:21-23 (The Living Bible), ‚Äú...Christ, who suffered for you, is your example. Follow in His steps. He never sinned... when He suffered.‚Äù Despite the sufferings, persecutions, temptations, and afflictions, Christ did not think, say, or do anything evil. Instead, He stood His ground obeying the will of God. He was able to do that because ‚ÄúHe left his case in the hand of God. 
We also have sufferings. Because of the strict community quarantine or lockdown, others had a difficult time getting basic necessities, like food. Others were bored, sad, panicky, afraid, and perhaps even angry. Because of stress or frustration, they lashed out or took it out on those around them, perhaps even on their loved-ones. Others resorted to doing things that are illegal and against the law of God. What‚Äôs worse is, there might be some brethren who are on the verge of giving up their divine election. Those things should not happen to us.
It is hard to be infected with the coronavirus. But it is far worse to be infected with doubt and disobedience. How can such brethren be consistently righteous? How, then, can they truly hope that God will save them in times of trouble? Hence, let us be consistently righteous no matter what the circumstance of our life is.
If the sufferings seems too hard to bear, let us leave our case with God by praying to Him fervently. In FirstPeter5:7 and 10 (EE), the apostles taught that, ‚ÄúTell God about all the things that make you sad or afraid or angry. Give your thoughts about those things to Him and let them remain with Him.‚Äù
It is only right that through prayers, we tell God our troubles because ‚ÄúYou will have trouble and pain for a short time. But after that, God, who is so completely kind, will make everything right.‚Äù 
We can truly hope that God will bestow His mercy by making everything right for us. That‚Äôs because we matter to Him, for we are the ones whom He caused to be united to Christ when He called us to be parts of the body of Christ or members of the Church Of Christ. 
But God does not want us just to be members of the Church Of Christ. He wants as well that we ‚Äúwill live with Him in the beautiful place where He lives‚Äù‚Äîin the Holy City, where there are no more pain, suffering, and death. There, everything will be right for us. Despite many sufferings, we are certain to reach that place because ‚ÄúHe will make [us]strong, so that nothing can ever stop [us]believing Him.‚Äù
We will surely surmount whatever sufferings we may have, even those brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. Because we are members of the Church Of Christ, our Lord God reserves for us His mercy. When we are determined to obey Him and are consistently righteous, He will protect us day by day and save us in times of trouble. Above all, He will grant us entrance into the Holy City.

WE NEED TO DO OUR PART FOR OUR FAITH TO BE STRENGTHENED

In  times  of  trouble  and  suffering,  one  of  the  things  that  commonly arise in people‚Äôs heartsis doubt. As God‚Äôs chosen ones, we must not allow that to overcome usbecause, as the Bible states, doubters will notreceive anything fromthe Lord. Thus, we shouldhave faith and make it flourish. 

According to Apostle Paul, in Romans 10:17 and 15 (Last Days Bible), people will only come to have faith ‚Äúby sincerely listening to what God wants  to  tell  you.‚ÄùHowever,  people  should  not  listen  to  just  anyone who claims tospeak about the Lord, but only to those who are sent by God. God‚Äôs messengersare the ones who can teach the true knowledge of God, according to Malachi 2:7 (Good News Bible). That iswhy God commandspeople to ‚ÄúGo to themto learn My will.‚Äù When one listens to anyone who is not a messenger of God, he will not learn the will or the words of God; hence, that person will not havethe true faith.

We, members of the Church Of Christ,are sure that we have received the  true  faith  because  we  are  the  result  of  the  preaching  of  Brother Felix Manalo, God‚Äôs Messenger in these last days. Although God laid him to rest, we remain in the true faith because we continue to receive God‚Äôs will through the Church Administration who was entrusted ‚Äúto make  God‚Äôs  message  fully  known,‚Äù  according  to  Colossians  1:25 (Holman Christian Standard Bible).

The  Church  Administration  labors  and  strives  to  fulfill  the  divine authority and duty to preach God‚Äôs words. They are doing that so the Christians will reach spiritual maturity, as what Apostle Paul declared in  Colossians  1:28-29 (Amplified  Bible).  Our  Executive  Minister, Brother Eduardo V. Manalo, tirelessly teaches us so we will be strong in the faith.

Because of that, we should then do our part: Let us hold on to what our  Executive  Minister  teaches  to  us,  as  what  Apostle  Paul  said  in Second  Thessalonians  2:13-15 (New International Reader‚Äôs Version): ‚ÄúBrothers and sisters, stand firm. Hold on to what we taught you. We passed our teachings on to you by what we preached and wrote.‚Äù

We  usually  receive  God‚Äôs words  that  the  Church  Administration teaches during ourworship service. That is why we should be devoted to attending our worship services for us to be strong in the faith.

Moreover, in Colossians 2:8 (New Life Version), Apostle Paul instructed, ‚ÄúBe careful that no one changes your mind and faith by much learning and big sounding ideas.‚Äù In these times when people are subjected to information overload and there is a proliferationof fake news, especially in  social  media,  we  should  be  careful.When  it  comes  to  the  true religion, one  should  not  believe  in any  idea  or  information  that  goes againstGod‚Äôs words preached by the Messenger and continues to be taught by the Church Administration.

Also,  in  Second  Thessalonians  2:15 (LDB),  the  Bible  teaches  us  to, ‚ÄúContinue to stand firm in your determination to live  only  to  please God.‚Äù What pleases God is definitely not disobedience, but obedience. Hence, an obedient Church member is the one who will be strong and become even stronger in the faith. 

However, we should not be content that we are the only ones who are strong in the faith. According to Romans 15:1-2 (Easy-to-Read Version): ‚ÄúWe are strong with faith. So we should help the people who are weak.‚Äù Hence, ‚ÄúWe should not try to please ourselves ... We should do this to help them. We should try to help them be stronger in faith.‚Äù

According to Hebrews 10:24 (LDB), to help the weak be stronger in the faith, ‚ÄúWe should continue to be truly concerned about one another, to help stimulate each other to show love.‚Äù We can show or prove our love for  God  by  obeying  His  commands.  Hence,  when  we  remind  and encourage our brethren to be active in doing good deeds, we help them become stronger in the faith.

Worshiping God is one of the good deedsin which we shouldstrive to make the weak active. ApostlePaulsaidin Hebrews 10:25 (Translation for Translators), ‚ÄúWe must not cease assembling ourselves toworship the Lord.‚Äù Hence, it is the duty of eachChurch member toencourageand exhort others. Let us do that all the more since we know that the day that the Lord will return is near.

The   children   should   also   be   strengthened   in   the   faith.   In Deuteronomy 6:6-7 (NIRV), this is what Moses, a messenger of God and  one  who  administered  ancient  Israel,  instructed  the  parents: ‚ÄúThe commandments I give you today must be in your hearts. Make sureyour children learn them.‚Äù And so, it is the duty of the parents to instill the true faith in their children at all opportune timesand make sure that they learn God‚Äôs teachings that wehave received from God‚Äôs Messenger and the Church Administration.

According to Deuteronomy 4:9 (Contemporary English Version), parents should  tell  their  children  the  things  that  they  have  seen  God  do  for them. From the time of God‚Äôs Messenger to our time, God has guided and  sheltered  the  Church  from  intense  trials  and  persecutions.  We have seen before our very eyes the phenomenal victories of the Church come one after the other, especially now during the administration of Brother Eduardo Manalo. That is because God fulfilled and continues to  fulfill  His  promise  to strengthen,  help,  and  uphold  theMessenger and this mission in theselast days.

God did those things as well to each of us.He is the OneWho delivered us from hardship, sickness, sorrows, and wickedness. It is only proper to tell our children about the wondrous things that God has done in our lives so they will learn also to trust and firmly believein God.

For our faith nottoweaken in the face of trouble and suffering, let us do  what  is  stated  in  Hebrews  10:22-23 (The  Living  Bible): ‚ÄúLet us go right in to God ... with true hearts fully trusting Him to receive us.‚Äù 

We  are  sure  that  God  will  receive  us  when we go  to  Him  in  prayer ‚Äúbecause we have been sprinkled with Christ‚Äôs blood to make us clean.‚Äù Hence, one who goes to God or prays to Him needs to be counted among those who were redeemed and are obedient or members of the Church Of Christ who are obedient. And when we pray to God,there should never be any room for doubt because ‚Äúthere is no question that He will do what He says.‚Äù

Thus,  let  us  do  what  the  Executive  Minister  is  calling  on  us to  do: Dedicate ourselves to our devotional prayers‚Äîpersonal and householdprayers‚Äîand to the complete renewal of life.

When we take refuge and find confidence in God, according to Psalm 57:1-2 (AMP), we can implore Him to be merciful and gracious to us, especially as we facecalamities and destructive storms of life. When we remain strong in the faith no matter what comes into our lives, God will not forsake us. He will  bring to  pass His wonderful  purposes for us,which is why we are completely sure that we will not be defeated by trouble  and  suffering.  Above  all,  we  will  receive  salvation,  which  He promised to us.

Also, the minister does not mention the chapter and verse of the passages he mentioned. Probably either because he was hurrying or he did not want the member to go search it in the Bible!

THE ELECTION OF THE MESSENGER OF GOD IN THESE LAST DAYS AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH ADMINISTRATION

It is very important for every member of the Church Of Christ to understand and firmly believe in the significance of God's sending a Messenger and of His placing an Administration in the Church so that each one will become strong in the faith and certain of salvation.

God sent His messenger in these last days through biblical prophecy, as what is written in Isaiah 46:11-13 (New King James Version):11Calling a bird of prey from the east, the man who executes My counsel, from a far country. Indeed, I have spoken it; I will also bring it to pass. I have purposed it; I will also do it. 12Listen to Me, you stubborn-hearted, who are far from righteousness: 13I bring My righteousness near, it shall not be far off; My salvation shall not linger. And I will place salvation in Zion, For Israel My glory.

God called a man who would execute His counsel like a bird of prey. He would come from a far country in the east or Far East. We firmly believe that the fulfillment of this prophecy was Brother Felix Manalo, whose work began in the Philippines, a country in the Far East.It has also been taught to us that God would call a Messenger at the time called ‚Äúends of the earth‚Äù or when the end of the world is near, as signified by the outbreak of a world war, according to the prophecy of Christ in Matthew 24:3, 33, and 6-8. That was fulfilled on July 27, 1914 when Brother Felix Manalo registered the Church Of Christ in the Philippines.
Concerning the work of His Messenger, God said, ‚ÄúI bring My righteousness near, it shall not be far off; My salvation shall not linger.‚Äù Thus, the work entrusted to the Messenger is God's last work of salvation.

God's righteousness is the gospel, which is the power of God to salvation, according to Romans 1:16-17. In fulfillment of the prophecy, Brother Felix Manalo preached God‚Äôs words written in the Bible. His work of preaching the gospel was likened to thatof a bird of prey because, through it, he would snatch people from false religions and from the impending punishment on Judgment Day.

In the prophecy, God also said, ‚ÄúI will place salvation in Zion.‚Äù Zion refers to the Church, which is ‚Äúcomposed of all those registered in heaven‚Äù who were ‚Äúredeemed,‚Äù based on Hebrews 12:22-23 (The Living Bible). What was redeemed with the blood of Christ is the Church Of Christ, according to Acts 20:28 (Lamsa Translation). Therefore, the work entrusted by God to His Messenger in the last days, Brother Felix Manalo, was to preach the true Church Of Christ. Its members are certain of receiving salvation. 

Revelation 7:2-3 describes the Messenger and his work as follows:2Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea, saying, 3‚ÄúDo not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.

The prophecy speaks of ‚Äúanother angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God.‚Äù The east being referred to is also the Far East, the Philippines, where Brother Felix Manalo began his work.

We are certain that he is the one referred to in this prophecy as ‚Äúanother angel‚Äù because the term ‚Äúangel‚Äù means messenger, according to this same verse as rendered in the Young's Literal Translation. Thus, the term ‚Äúangel‚Äù does not refer to nature or state of being but to office or duty. According to the prophecy, the task of the messenger was to seal the servants of God on their foreheads. He is not alone in that work because he said ‚Äútill we have sealed. ‚ÄùThe seal, based on Ephesians 1:13-14 (Good News Bible), is the Holy Spirit‚Äîthe ‚Äústamp of ownership‚Äù given to those who have the right as God‚Äôs people and the guarantee that they will receive the inheritance, which is salvation. People are sealed when they firmly believe in the true message preached by God's messenger. Thus, the work of God's messenger is very important.

For this reason, Christ teaches us in John 6:29 (Knox Translation) to believe in the one whom God has sent. Just as many believed the messengers in the past, such as Noah, Moses, the prophets, the apostles, and the greatest of them all, our Lord Jesus Christ, we should also firmly believe God‚Äôs sending of Brother Felix Manalo as His 
Messenger.

His authority as a true messenger of God is proven by the prophecies in the Bible and the truths written therein that he taught.  Although the Messenger in these last days passed away, we are able to remain in the truth and are certain of salvation because,  as foretold also in the prophecy, the Messenger has companions in the work of sealing the servants of God. They are the ministers of the Church, led by the Executive Minister.

The authority and office of the minister appointed to administer the Church and make known God‚Äôs message is from God Himself, according to Colossians 1:25 (Holman Christian Standard Bible). Upon the passing of Brother Felix Manalo, the one who succeeded him as Executive Minister of the Church was Brother Era√±o Manalo. When he passed away, the one who succeeded him is Brother Eduardo Manalo, the current Executive Minister of the Church. 

Therefore, even though the messenger-leader had passed away, the authority and office to administer and preach did not die with him but have been passed on to the one appointed and placed by God to administer the entire Church so the work of salvation will continue. Like the messengers of God in the past entrusted with the ministry of reconciliation, the Executive Minister also has the role of administering and leading people in their reconciliation with God, according to Second Corinthians 5:18-20. 

God also gave them the authority for edification, according to Second Corinthians 13:10. Therefore, we must be united in all the activities that the Church Administration launches for the edification of our faith. To strengthen further our hope for salvation, Brother Eduardo Manalo is working ‚Äúwith a tireless intensity‚Äù to oversee, teach, and lead us in all activities in the Church. He is doing that to present every member of the Church Of Christ perfect in Christ, according to Colossians1:28-29 (The Passion Translation). 

Moreover, as stated in Second Peter 1:12-13 (New Living Translation 2015), our Executive Minister always reminds us about these things so we will remain ‚Äústanding firm in the truth‚Äù taught to us.  That is why, in every worship service and even in other occasions, we receive exhortations from our Executive Minister to love and value our divine election. He always reminds us of the grace and blessings that will be ours as God has promised and encourages us to put all our hope in them. 

The instruction of the Executive Minister is just as what is written in Second Peter 1:10-11 (Good News Bible):10So then, my friends, try even harder to make God‚Äôs call and his choice of you a permanent experience; if you do so, you will never abandon your faith. 11In this way you will be given the full right to enter the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

Let us remain united with the Executive Minister and obey all the teachings of God that we receive in our worship services. Doing so, we will find all the help and strength we need. We will remain secure in our calling and hope until the Second Advent of Christ. We will all rejoice together in our true home, the Holy City, enjoying the true and eternal life.

* standard officers' prayer hymn (235)
* short and sweet yet otherwise standard hymn of praise (61)
* showtune about being saved with a verse dedicated to duty/obedience (56)
* hymn about the messenger (401)
* obedience/submission hymn (367)

* before text hymn (217)
* offering hymn (122)
* showtune that outlines the condition of the outside world in verses 1 and 2, obedience/submission in the refrain, and duty in verse 3 (290)

I'm not sure what exactly the music department and the higher-ups are going for, but I don't think it's a good thing if the highlight of the hymns (at least IMO) is the first hymn or the hymn before the text. Isn't the high point supposed to be the 3rd and/or 4th hymn (maybe 2nd depending on the lineup)? Are we supposed to be crying our eyes out during a hymn about the messenger or a submission/obedience hymn?

*Tangent:* Looking at the preludes/interludes today, I saw no fewer than four hymns (341; 278; 268; 244) that were about the messenger (and the latter three were even played back to back). The reason I say ""no fewer than four"" is because I can't remember what 352 is about. To me, it's a nice-sounding hymn, but part of me wouldn't be surprised if the lyrics would cause uneasiness to the average person. Anyway, I digress. Moving forward...

**Sermon**  
Honestly, I can't find much to say apart from what others have already said. It's just a cookie-cutter ""lesson"" about how we should hold onto our calling and we are (supposedly) the ones God called to be saved. Did the Administration decide to stop teaching the other lessons? Did the other lessons ""accidentally"" get deleted or lost somehow?

*Tangent*: My resident worker managed to plug the Bible Studies and devotional prayers into the sermon and claim that attending them is what God requires of us. First of all, do we not have free will? Or are the current ministers programmed not to believe such a concept? Second, why do some ministers (not all, I hope) plug such events and then some into the WS actual? Is WS not a sacred time devoted to God and Christ?

Really makes you wonder what today's ministers & workers are being taught...and it really makes you hope & pray there are exceptions to this rule.",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/j3obta/weekend_worship_service_examination_oct_02_oct_05/

HOW MUCH DO WE LOVE OUR MEMBERHIP IN THE CHURCH OF CHRIST?

We acknowledge that we received a great blessing from God when He called us into the Church Of Christ. Through it, we will be saved by Christ from eternal punishment. It is also through our membership in the Church that we are able to render the true, meaningful, and acceptable worship and service to God by virtue of the right we received. It is only proper that we highly regard our membership in the Church Of Christ. Let us love and take good care of it. 

Let us now take the time to ponder: How much do we love our membership in the Church Of Christ? Looking back, why did we join the Church Of Christ?  

We joined the Church Of Christ because of our obedience to the Savior, our Lord Jesus Christ. According to John 10:3, 7 and 9 (Revised English Bible), Christ said that He is the door of the sheepfold. He was not referring to literal sheep, but to people, because He added that anyone who comes into the fold through Him will be saved.  

Based on Acts 20:28 (Lamsa Translation), the sheepfold‚Äîwhere those who entered through the door who is Christ and will be saved by Him‚Äîis the Church Of Christ. It is the Church that Christ purchased or redeemed with His blood. That is the reason we joined this Church.  

That is why we are reminded by the apostles in Hebrews 10:23-24 (Last Days Bible), to keep holding on firmly to the hope that we have‚Äîthat we will be saved by Christ. Let us put our hope on that blessing that will come.  

Because of that, all Church Of Christ members‚Äînot just the Church officers‚Äîhave a duty to stimulate or encourage each other to be more active. If there are those who are weakening and becoming cold in the faith, we should help each other to become active, especially if they are members of our household. We must show love to each other and be active in doing good deeds.  

And so, let us love our brethren in the Church. Let us love the Church. Let us love our membership in the Church Of Christ.

According to First Corinthians 16:14 (Amplified Bible), we can prove that we love our membership in the Church Of Church if everything that we do is done in love. What should motivate us in whatever we do is our love for God, for our Lord Jesus Christ, and for our fellowmen.  

According to John 14:15 (LDB), We can prove our love for our Lord Jesus Christ by doing what He tells us to do and by not doing the things He tells us not to do.  

Let us remember what is written in First John 5:3 (AMP) that if we obey God‚Äôs commands, we are able to prove our love for Him. That is why, we should keep His commandments and understand His ordinances and teachings. That is why our Executive Minister, Brother Eduardo Manalo, reminds us to conduct complete and intensive obedience to the teachings of God. In that way, we will be able to prove our love for God, for Christ, and for our membership in the Church Of Christ. 

To prevent our love for God, for Christ, and for the Church Of Christ from being ruined, the apostles instruct us in First Timothy 6:3-5 (Easy-to-Read Version) to never listen to anyone who teaches things that are false. 

It was forewarned long ago that there would be such kind of teachers. In these present times, there are also false teachers. They cannot accept the teachings that agree with the true way to serve God. They pretend to be wise and are so proud of what they know. They want to instill in the minds of people jealousy, quarrels, insults, and evil mistrust. That is what is being done by those who left and rebelled against the Church‚Äîtheir motive in teaching is to ruin people‚Äôs love for God, for Christ, and for the Church Of Christ. We should not listen or believe such kind of teachers because, as the Bible says, they have lost their understanding of the truth. They will only mislead people. Therefore, it is evil to listen to false prophets and their lies.  

The ones whom we should listen to are the messengers of God and the Church Administration that God placed in the Church to make His words known. According to Jeremiah 7:25-26 and 28 (New Life Version), God is angry with and resents His servants who do not listen to and accept the messengers whom He sent to them. God considers that as a horrendous sin. 

Hence, let us faithfully obey God‚Äôs teachings and ordinances that were taught by His Messenger and the Administration that He placed in the Church. That is how we can keep our love for God, for Christ, and for the Church Of Christ from being ruined so we will not be defeated by any kind of evil.  

Likewise, our Lord Jesus Christ teaches us in Matthew 16:24 (LDB)that we need to endure and sacrifice. We should not live for the purpose of pleasing and satisfying our own natural desires. That is the cross we should take up to fully obey or follow Christ. 

If that is the kind of faith and conviction that a member of the Church Of Christ has, he will not be defeated by any kind of evil in the world. No matter how strong the temptations are, he will not give in and disobey or violate the laws and teachings of God. No matter how severe persecutions are, he will never let anything separate him from the Church.  

According to Psalm 121:1-3 (ERV), we can rely on God to help and rescue us so we will not let go of our divine election even if we endure hardships and severe trials. Let us firmly believe that He will not allow us to fall into failure and misfortune.  

Hence, let us ask God for the help that we need for us to uphold our divine election. Let us put all our hope in Him and in the grace that will be ours, which He will grant us. Let us beseech Him to edify our faith and to make our love for Him, for His begotten Son, and for the holy Church to abound even more. May God help and guide us in our journey in this world so all of us can finish our race and reach the Holy City, which He promised to us.

EVERY CHURCH OF CHRIST MEMBER HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROCLAIM ALWAYS HIS SALVATION TO OTHERS

Our membership in the Church Of Christ is of great value. We consider it our true wealth, which we will never exchange for anyone or anything in this world, no matter what. That‚Äôs because, as Church Of Christ members, we have been freed from the condemnation of God and have received His great love and mercy as His people. Through His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, we have been redeemed and forgiven of our sins, and now we are the ones whom God recognizes as His chosen ones. Hence, we have the hope of receiving salvation and eternal life. However, we should not keep to ourselves but share with our fellowmen the grace that we received. 

Every Church Of Christ member has the responsibility to always proclaim his redemption and salvation to others. That is what God commands and expects from those He redeemed. Psalm 107:2-3 (Holman Christian Standard Bible) states, ‚ÄúLet the redeemed of the Lord proclaim that He has redeemed them ... and gathered them from the lands‚Äîfrom the east and the west, from the north and the south.‚Äù  

According to the prophecy of God written in Isaiah 62:11-12 (Modern English Version), the redeemed of the Lord who should proclaim that He has redeemed them is ‚Äúthe daughter of Zion‚Äù from the ‚Äúends of the earth.‚Äù The ‚Äúdaughter of Zion‚Äù refers to the Church Of Christ in these last days. The Bible testifies that this Church is the ‚ÄúHoly People, the Redeemed of the Lord‚Äù and ‚Äú[its] salvation comes‚Äù as ‚ÄúHisrecompense.‚Äù  

The Church Of Christ was purchased or redeemed by the blood of Christ (Acts 20:28 LamsaTranslation). Thus, we are the ones whom God expects to proclaim our redemption or salvation.  

The Church today is composed of people called from 158 countries and territories. So, what is written in Psalm 107:2-3 (HCSB)is being fulfilled: ‚ÄúFrom the lands‚Äîfrom the east and the west, from the north and the south‚Äù God has gathered or called those counted as redeemed.  

So, in whatever country we are, we should proclaim our redemption or salvation because it is the will of God for every member of the Church Of Christ.

According to Psalm 40:9-10 (HCSB), we fulfill the will of God to proclaim our redemption or salvation by proclaiming His righteousness and salvation. We should not keep silent and keep this to ourselves. We should proclaim and speak of it to our fellowmen.  

No Church Of Christ member should avoid the responsibility to help in proclaiming the gospel and persuading others to join the true Church. Because, according to John 15:16, the reason we were called and chosen as members of the Church Of Christ is for us to bear fruit.  

When we fulfill the purpose of our being called, which is to bear fruit, we glorify the Father, according to Christ as written in John 15:8. Aside from that, we also prove that we are Christ‚Äôs true disciples and that we value our membership in the Church Of Christ.

According to Romans 16:5 (Amplified Version) and 16 (Revised Geneva Translation), one kind of fruit expected of us is to convert people to Christ or help them become members of the Church Of Christ. Thus, just as living in the newness of life, loving the brotherhood, being prayerful, attending the worship service, giving voluntary offerings, and participating in all Church activities are fruits or works of holiness expected of us, we are expected as well to bear much fruit by bringing many converts or new members into the Church. We can do that when we are active in sharing our faith, according to Philemon 1:6 (New International Version).

Thus, let us invite our fellowmen to attend our worship services, evangelical missions, and Bible studies; to tune in to our radio, TV, and online religious programs; and to read the magazine, Pasugo: God‚Äôs Message. In that way, people will learn the correct manner of serving and worshiping God conducted in the Church Of Christ. Let us lead and guide them in every step of joining the Church until they are baptized. 

Let us fully believe that all our efforts and sacrifices in helping the work of propagation are not in vain, according to Apostle Paul in First Corinthians 15:58. It is mentioned in the Mace New Testament version of this verse that the Lord will not leave your Christian labor unrewarded. 

According to the Lord Jesus Christ, in John 15:16, one of the rewards that we will receive for actively helping in the work of propagation is that God will answer our prayers. In these times of trouble and hardship, we need all the help and support that we can obtain from God. When we fulfill His purpose of choosing and calling us to bear fruit, we can expect God to answer our prayers as Christ promised. We are also storing up for ourselves a firm basis for obtaining the true life or everlasting life, according to First Timothy 6:18-19 (New International Reader‚Äôs Version).

Let us follow the dedication made by the Christians in the first century in sharing their faith. It says in Acts 5:42 (NIV), ‚ÄúDay after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ.‚Äù May we also find time everyday to share our faith with others‚Äîbe it in our own homes, in the missionary centers, or in the house of worship‚Äîto bear abundant fruit to please and glorify God. 

To succeed in our duty to share our faith with others and to bring glory to God, let us earnestly and sincerely pray and ask help from God, as what is taught in Ephesians 3:14 (The Living Bible) and 20-21 (Traducci√≥n En Lenguaje Actual). He has the power to do much more than we ask.  

As the Church Administration always reminds us, let us all hold personal and family prayers to ask not only for our daily needs but also for His help and for the strength and success we need in fulfilling our duties to Him at all times.

THE PEOPLE WHOM THE BIBLE IDENTIFIES AS BLESSED

People of this world use various standards and measures in identifying who are blessed. For some, the measure of being blessed is the amount of wealth or material possessions a person has. For others, it is based on how successful a person is in his quest for and advancement in knowledge. Some think that blessed are those who have strong and healthy bodies, while others suppose that those who have power and influence in society are also blessed.

However, let us not forget that we all were created by God and He owns us. And so, the people whom God identifies as blessed, based on His words written in the Bible, are the ones who are truly blessed. This is how the Bible identifies who are blessed, in Revelation 14:13 (Goodspeed translation): ‚ÄúBlessed are the dead who from this time forth die as Christians!‚Äù Therefore, for a person to be among the blessed ones, he must be a Christian and remain as such until his death. If a person became a follower of Christ for a while, yet was separated from Him and was no longer a Christian when he died, he cannot be considered as blessed.

However, just because a person says he is a Christian, it does not mean he really is a Christian. The apostles explained that a true Christian does what Christ tells him to do (First John 2:4, The Living Bible). One of Christ‚Äôs commands is to come into the fold (John 10:7 and 9, Revised English Bible). The fold or flock is the Church Of Christ, according to Acts 20:28 (Lamsa translation).Therefore, we, members of the Church Of Christ, are the true Christians today because we did what our Lord Jesus Christ told us to do. We are the ones whom the Bible identifies as blessed‚Äîas long as we remain as true Christians until death. Hence, let us never allow ourselves to be separated from the Church Of Christ.However, it is not enough that a person is inside the Church Of Christ for him to be blessed and be certain of salvationon the Second Advent of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Church Of Christ members who will be blessed on Judgment Day are the ones identified in Luke 12:38 and 40 (Contemporary English Version):

38Those servants are really fortunate if their master finds them ready, even though he comes late at night or early in the morning. 40So always be ready! You don‚Äôt know when the Son of Man will come.

Because we do not know when our Lord Jesus Christ will come, we should always be ready. According to Luke 21:36 and 34 (Amplified Bible), those who are always ready keep themselves awake, watch at all times, and pray. They also guard themselves so their hearts will not be weighed down by self-indulgence, drunkenness, and worldly cares or concerns with which many people are preoccupied. If we do not guard ourselves, we might end up in misfortune, instead of being blessed on the Second Advent of the Lord.

To those who were instructed to keep watch or were assigned specific tasks or duties, Christ said to them: ‚ÄúStay at your post.‚Äù (Mark 13:32-36, The Message). Because all of us were given tasks or duties to fulfill, we should neither forsake nor be lazy in performing such duties in the Church. We should neither quit nor turn our backs on them. We should be found on the Lord‚Äôs return fulfilling our Church duties so we will be counted among the blessed. 

James 5:11 (Today‚Äôs New International Version) also identifies as blessed those who persevere, like Job. He proved his perseverance by remaining loyal to God despite the severe trials that he had gone through. Almost instantly, his livelihood was depleted, his ten children all died at the same time, and he was stricken with painful boils from the sole of his feet to the top of his head. His wife even persecuted him. However, despite all those things, he held on to his faith in God.

We should follow the example of Job‚Äôs perseverance and loyalty. In that way, we will also be blessed and will pass the test no matter how heavy the trial that will come to us is. Let us firmly believe what is written in James 1:12 (Expanded Bible) that ‚Äúafter [we] have proved [our] faith [stood/endured/passed the test]‚Äù through perseverance, ‚ÄúGod will reward [us] with life forever.‚Äù

That is why we are always reminded by Brother Eduardo Manalo to persevere and stand our ground in obeying God‚Äôs commands. We must do all that so we can remain as the blessed ones because what is at stake is the reward of receiving eternal life, which God has promised to us. It is assured in Psalm 106:3 (EXB) that: 
Happy [Blessed] are those who do [keep; observe; guard] right [justice], who do what is fair [righteous] at all times.

Therefore, doing what is righteous and fair is not something that we should doonly when we feel like doing it or when it is convenient. Instead, let us continue upholding it at all times for us to remain being blessed.

Let us also firmly believe what is stated in Psalm 84:4 (Easy-to-Read Version) that ‚ÄúPeople living at Your temple are very fortunate.‚Äù The equivalent of living at the temple is always going to the house of worship to worship God. So, we should never forsake the worship service; instead, let us always be eager for it. 

We may be poor and insignificant based on human standards‚Äînot rich in material possessions, not having much knowledge, no power or influence in society‚Äîhowever, if we are among God‚Äôs chosen servants who are dedicated to worshiping and praising Him, we are truly blessed. The Bible assures in Isaiah 30:18(AMP) that God Himself longs to be gracious to those who earnestly draw near to Him, and expect and look for His loving-kindness and companionship. That is what God feels towards us whenever we worship and ask Him our needs.

Hence, let us confide in God whatever problems we have. Let us firmly believe that He is eager to care for us, to help us, and to grant us the blessings that we need. Let us present to Him all our troubles, worries, hardships, and various problems. Let us ask Him to give us the strength that we need to uphold our God-given election until the end.

BASED ON THE LESSON OUTLINED
BY BROTHER RANDY L. WEIR 
SATURDAY/SUNDAY: OCTOBER 17/18, 2020

Many people assume that just because they believe in God and in Christ, or have accepted Christ as their personal Savior, they are already assured of salvation. So, they refuse to believe that membership in the Church Of Christ is necessary in serving and worshiping God and in receiving salvation.

The Church established by Christ is very important for man to receive salvation because, as taught in Ephesians 3:21 (The Living Bible),the Church is God's master plan of salvation.  That Church is the ‚ÄúChurch Of Christ‚Äù*(Ephesians 3:21 Traducci√≥n en Lenguaje Actual). 

According to Ephesians 1:9 (New International Reader's Version) and 10 (New King James Version), God's plan is for all to be gathered together as one in Christ. That will be fulfilled when people become members of the body of Christ or the Church Of Christ (First Corinthians 12:27 and 12 Weymouth New Testament). 

People should join the Church because it is what the Lord Jesus Christ will save. It was made certain in Ephesians 5:23 (TLB) that: ‚ÄúHe gave His very life to take care of it and be its Savior! ‚ÄùThe apostles testified that the Church Of Christ is the one for which Christ gave His life (Acts 20:28 Lamsa Translation).

Thus, anyone who truly wants to be saved must accept and believe the teaching of the Bible that God has a master plan of salvation. To benefit from that plan, one needs to become a member of the Church Of Christ.  

One further proof that God wants everyone to be saved is taught by Apostle Paul in Colossians 1:13-14 (New English Translation) that God transfers people from darkness into the kingdom of His Son, Jesus Christ. It is where ‚Äúredemption, the forgiveness of sins‚Äù are found. The Church Of Christ is the one redeemed or purchased by Christ's blood.

It is very important to be redeemed and forgiven of sins through Christ's blood because it is stated in Hebrews 9:14 (Easy-to-Read Version),‚ÄúHis blood will make us pure ... so that we can worship (serve) the living God.‚Äù  

Hence, because Christ redeemed the Church Of Christ, its members have received the right to render the true service and worship to the Lord God. Because of sin, people have lost that inherent right, and they were placed under the judgment of God‚Äîpunishment on Judgment Day. But, by being a member of the Church Of Christ, man will be able to obtain the right to worship God and the hope to be saved from the impending punishment. Thanks be to God for we are now members of the Church Of Christ. Let us love and cherish our Church membership and always worship God.In Psalm 31:19-20 (The Message), the Bible guarantees that God has a stack of blessings piled up for those who worship Him. We need that especially now that life in this world is filled with many hardships, trials, worries, and troubles. If we dedicate ourselves to the true worship of God, we can hope for His help and blessings. It is stated in Psalm 34:9 (MSG): Worship God if you want the best; worship opens doors to all his goodness.

And so, the strict instruction to us in Hebrews 10:25 (Contemporary English Version) is that we must not get out ‚Äúof the habit of meeting for worship.‚Äù

Thus, let us not forsake our worship services whatever trials and problems we are going through. God gave us the right to worship Him; hence, let us value and be devoted to fulfilling it. Let us always render the true worship to God so we can always please Him. If there are some who are forsaking the worship service, let us remind and encourage them to be devoted to this duty and right of ours.  

We should never give up or forsake our worship service because according to First Corinthians 14:26 (ERV), it is by being devoted to our meeting together to worship God that we grow stronger in faith. Let us firmly believe what is stated in First Peter 1:5 & 9 (ERV):
5God‚Äôs power protects you through your faith, and it keeps you safe until your salvation comes. That salvation is ready to be given to you at the end of time.
9Your faith has a goal. And you are receiving that goal‚Äîyour salvation. 

So, if we are going through trials and difficulties, we should all the more continue worshiping God for us to remain strong in the true faith and be protected by His power.

For us to always experience that in our lives as members of the Church Of Christ, let us promise God what His early servants also promised, as stated in Ephesians 3:21 and 20 (TLA):
21All who belong to the church of Christ, we should praise him forever. ...
20God has the power to do much more than we ask. We can‚Äôt even imagine what God can do to help us with his power!*

We are so blessed because God has made us understand the importance of the Church Of Christ. We should also share that truth to our fellowmen. Let us help out and participate in the work of propagation so more people will also understand and firmly believe that they need the Church Of Christ to be saved.

And, on our part as members of the Church Of Christ, let us treasure and hold on to our Church membership whatever troubles and problems we encounter in life. With God‚Äôs help, we can surely overcome all hindrances until we receive the promised salvation.

HELPING IN THE WORK OF PROPAGATION IS A WORK CONCERNING SALVATION; THUS, IT MUST BE GIVEN IMPORTANCE

It is the great desire of the Church Administration for all members of the Church Of Christ to be saved from the wrath of God on Judgment Day. For that to happen, the Church Administration leads and encourages us to participate in the activities of the Church because all those activities are for the fulfillment of God‚Äôs will to strengthen our faith so we will put all our hope on the grace that will be ours. 

One of the activities that we should participate in is the work of evangelism or sharing our faith.  We are always being encouraged by the Church Administration to be active in this work because through it, we proclaim the Good News of God‚Äôs salvation, according to Psalm 40:9-10. Thus, it is of utmost importance that we participate in the work of propagation because it is a work concerning salvation.

God‚Äôs salvation was revealed to us. According to Romans 5:8-9, although we were sinners, God demonstrated His love toward us when He sent Christ who died for us. We, members of the Church Of Christ, were redeemed by the blood of Christ, according to Acts 20:28 (Lamsa translation), so ‚Äúwe shall be saved from wrath through Him.‚Äù

It is only proper that we give importance to the grace of salvation that we received from God, whatever happens. We must not keep to ourselves or hide God‚Äôs righteousness and truth; instead, we must proclaim His salvation. Let us share it with our fellowmen for them also to be saved from the wrath of God on Judgment Day.  

So, let us fully participate in the propagation of the words of God. This is one of the truths that the Church Administration teaches us‚Äîthe truth that is ‚Äúbased on the hope for eternal life,‚Äù according to Titus 1:1-2 (Good News Bible). Let us continue to obey and submit to our Executive Minister, Brother Eduardo Manalo because what he teaches is for our salvation on Judgment Day. When we share the true gospel to our fellowmen, we strengthen our hope of receiving the eternal life. 

The apostles attest that those who help in the work of propagation are assured of receiving salvation on Judgment Day. According to Philippians 4:3, their names are written in the Book of Life. Therefore, it is not only those whom we convinced to join the Church and remained therein who are certain of salvation. We, who helped in the propagation of God‚Äôs words, also have such an assurance. So, we are not at the losing end if we participate in the Church‚Äôs work of propagation, even if we have to sacrifice and endure in doing so. That is what the Church Administration always reminds us.  

The Church Administration has a holy purpose in their endeavors, which is shared as well by all Church officers. It says in Ephesians 4:11-12 (Norlie‚Äôs Simplified New Testament), ‚ÄúThe common object of their labor was to bring the Christians maturity, to prepare them for Christian service and the building up of the Church of Christ.‚Äù Hence, we should never get tired of uniting with and participating in all the activities that the Church Administration launches. 

We will be able to participate in the work of salvation if we have compassion or love for our fellowmen, according to Jude 1:22-23 (King James Version). Therefore, we are able to fulfill the important task: to ‚Äúothers save with fear, pulling them out of the fire.‚Äù Because Judgment Day is truly fast approaching, we should not disregard the work of sharing our faith; instead, we should zealously and actively participate in it for others to be saved.

Whenever we share our faith with others, we must treat each person kindly, according to Jude 1:22 (Last Days Bible). Because not all people are the same, we must approach people in different ways that are appropriate, with gentleness, compassion, and kindness. To be effective in proclaiming the truth that saves, according to Romans 12:11 and 13 (New English Translation), let us always show that we are zealous about our faith. We should always be enthusiastic as we serve the Lord. Let us also ‚Äúpursue hospitality.‚Äù Let us warmly welcome people to our homes for Bible study and group prayer meetings, and to our worship services, evangelical missions, and other Church activities.  

Through our voluntary offerings, we can also show a ‚Äúgenuine act of service‚Äù to the ‚Äúcommitment to spread the Good News of Christ,‚Äù according to Second Corinthians 9:7 (New International Reader‚Äôs Version) and 12-13 (God‚Äôs Word). Through our generosity in our voluntary offerings, we support our work of propagation through radio and TV, the Church‚Äôs websites, the Pasugo: God‚Äôs Message, and the sending of ministers and ministerial workers to different parts of the world to lead in the propagation of the gospel.

It is very important to labor in the works of the Lord. Hence, according to Isaiah 57:10 (International Children‚Äôs Bible), let us work hard and never give up or quit. Let us also be prayerful and trust in God. In doing so, we can find renewed strength to continue and to never stop in the activities that bring salvation to many people.

When we do that, we will be assured of a blessed reward. This is the testimony in Galatians 6:9 (Easy-to-Read-Version): We must not get tired of doing good. We will receive our harvest of eternal life at the right time. We must not give up.

Thus, may all of us actively participate in the work of propagation. By doing so, not only do we help our fellowmen in receiving salvation but also we strengthen our hope in attaining the promised eternal life. 

In our prayers to God, let us implore Him to give us the strength to obey His commands and to direct us to those whom we can invite to know His will. May more people receive the right to serve Him and be included in the work of salvation. 

Before we pray, we will sing
‚ÄúI Am A Member Of The Church Of Christ‚Äù

WHAT WE MUST HOLD ON FIRMLY TO SO AS TO REMAIN IN OUR DIVINE ELECTION

There are many things and events that people are experiencing that cause some to weaken in the faith, grow cold in their love for God, or lose hope. There are those who did not remain in their divine election and were separated from the Church. That should not happen to us. Let us never forget that our Lord Jesus Christ assures that those who remain until the end are the ones who will be saved.  

For us to remain until the end, we must hold firmly to the gospel preached to us by the Messenger of God and the Administration in the Church. According to First Corinthians 15:1-2 (Contemporary English Version), ‚ÄúYou will be saved by this message, if you hold firmly to it.‚Äù If we do not hold onto it, our faith will be for nothing and will not help us to be saved.  

However, it is not enough to merely say that we firmly believe and are holding on to the teachings. According to Philippians 4:9 (Last Days Bible), ‚ÄúYou must also continue to put into practice all you have learned and received.‚Äù We should do this not just once or just when we want to. It should be a continuous practice. Therefore, we should never stop fulfilling the teachings taught to us. We are aware what those teachings are: always worship God and never forsake our congregational worship service; help out in the work of propagation by inviting guests to listen during our evangelical missions; do not forget the giving of offerings that is pleasing to God; uphold the love for brotherhood; obey and submit to the one who administers the Church; fulfill the complete renewal of life; and avoid all evil deeds. Let us obey those teachings.  

What the Lord Jesus Christ requires of us is careful obedience to God‚Äôs commands. In John 14:15 (LDB), He said that those who truly love Him will do what He tells them to do, and not do what He tells them not to do. Let us not distort what Christ said, like what those who do not truly love Him do.  

Christ said that those who enter into the fold or Church Of Christ will be saved, based on John 10:9 and 16 (Revised English Bible) and Acts 20:28 (Lamsa translation). But others refuse to do that because they say that joining the Church is not needed for one to be saved. On the other hand, what Christ forbade in Matthew 23:9‚Äîthat no one should call any human being on earth ‚ÄúFather,‚Äù for there is only one Father in heaven, God, Who is the Father of souls‚Äîis what others are doing. Such prohibition of Christ is being violated in the religion whose priests are called ‚ÄúFather.‚Äù  

In the Church, we are careful in obeying the teachings of God because what is at stake when obeying or fulfilling them is our salvation. Let us imitate how Abraham obeyed without reservation what God told him to do. According to Hebrews 11:8(Easy-to-Read Version), although he had no idea where the land God promised to give him was, Abraham still followed God‚Äôs command to go there‚Äîno ifs and buts, no questioning the command, no dissent or reservation, ‚Äúbecause he had faith.‚Äù Therefore, those who will be able to obey God‚Äôs commands without dissent or reservation are the ones who have the same kind of faith that Abraham had. Abraham‚Äôs faith was so great that he decided to live on the basis of what God said He would do, according to Romans 4:18-21 (The Message). He entrusted his life to God. As proof, when God promised him that he would have a big family, he did not doubt even though he was already too old and his wife Sarah was also old and infertile. That goes against what many commonly expect: that a husband and wife who are in such a condition would never have a child. But Abraham countered that expectation by placing his hope in God‚Äôs power and what He can do. Abraham was fully convinced that what was promised to him would be fulfilled. 


We were also promised by God not just with salvation on Judgment Day but also with blessings in this life. Thus, when we are in dire situations that are seemingly impossible for us to overcome, we should not lose hope. Let us trust that God will fulfill His promise to us. Let us put our hope in the grace that will be ours.  

According to Colossians 1:23 (The Living Bible), we should fully and firmly believe the truth proclaimed to us by the Good News or the gospel‚Äîthat Christ died for those whom He will save. They are the ones who received the forgiveness of sins when they were purchased by His blood or the members of the Church Of Christ, according to Acts 20:28 (Lamsa). We should never shift from trusting that we will be saved by our Lord Jesus Christ.  

Thus, no matter what happens, let us firmly hold on to that we are assured of salvation inside the Church Of Christ only. We should never exchange our membership in the Church Of Christ for anything or anyone in this world. We should never allow ourselves to be parted from the Church.  

In upholding our divine election, we will experience difficulties and hardships. For us not to be moved from our trust and resolve, and to benefit from the promises and blessings of God, this is stated in Psalm 34:8 (TLB): Oh, put God to the test and see how kind he is! See for yourself the way his mercies shower down on all who trust in him.  

We have already proven many times in our life how kind God really is. For us to experience His mercy and blessings, we should trust in Him. We can express that by praying, according to Psalm 34:15 and 17 and 19 (ERV). The ones whose prayers will be heard and who will be protected by God are the people who do what is right. Thus, it is very important that we are always on the side of righteousness and stay away from evil. Let us fulfill what Brother Eduardo Manalo always reminds us to be prayerful to God. Let us ask for His help.

When we are worshiping God, praising His Name, and praying to Him, we can be sure that He will answer us, as written in Psalm 138:2-3 and 7 (Amplified Bible). He will strengthen our inner self, revive us, and save us against our enemies. Let us make use of this opportunity to bring to Him all our needs and ask for the solution to all our problems. Let us also plead with Him as what is written in Psalms85:6-7 (TLB):6Oh, revive us! Then your people can rejoice in you again. 7Pour out your love and kindness on us, Lord, and grant us your salvation.  

If, because of the hardships and troubles, our hearts faint and grow weak, let us ask God to revive us. If we are feeling sad and grieving, may He make us glad and allow us to rejoice once again. If we are lacking in our needs, may He pour out to us His love and kindness. And if our life is being threatened whether by evil-minded people or by a deadly disease, may He grant us His salvation. 

God is ready to grant us the solution to whatever trial and problem we confide in Him. Let us promise to Him that we will never stop from worshiping and serving Him. 

No matter what happens in our life, we will hold on firmly to the teachings that we received and will live by them until we finish our race.

HOUSEHOLD WORSHIP SERVICE
BASED ON THE LESSON OUTLINED
BY BROTHER EDUARDO V. MANALO SATURDAY/SUNDAY: OCTOBER 31/NOVEMBER 1, 2020

WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW THE ELECTION THAT WE RECEIVED FROM GOD TO BE WASTED

We received a great blessing when we became members of the Church Of Christ and have been included among the chosen of God. A person cannot just claim that he is one of the chosen of God. God is the One Who chooses and calls those whom He counts as His chosen. They are the ones who have been promised to receive the Holy Spirit, which is the proof that one will inherit God‚Äôs promises.

Based on Hebrews 3:14 (The Living Bible), the election received by the Christians who trust in God will not be wasted or become worthless ‚Äúif we are faithful to the end‚Äù because ‚Äúwe will share in all that belongs to Christ.‚Äù


But, just because a person claims or says that he is a Christian, it does not mean that he is already a Christian. First John 2:4 (TLB)states: Someone may say, ‚ÄúI am a Christian; I am on my way to heaven; I belong to Christ.‚Äù But if he doesn‚Äôt do what Christ tells him to, he is a liar. The word Christian means a follower of Christ. 

Therefore, one who refuses or does not obey the command of Christ is not a true Christian. One of Christ‚Äôs commands that true Christians obeyed and will lead to their receiving of salvation is what‚Äôs written in John 10:7 and 9 (Revised English Bible)‚Äî‚Äúcome into the fold through (Christ).‚Äù The sheepfold or flock is the Church Of Christ, according to Acts 20:28 (Lamsa translation). Therefore, those who obeyed Christ‚Äôs command to enter through Him so as to come into the fold or flock that He purchased and be saved are the members of the Church Of Christ. 

Therefore, we are the true Christians. We have come to understand this truth because God taught and made us understand it through His sending in these last days of Brother Felix Manalo. Even though he passed away, we continue to receive the words of God through the Executive Minister whom He placed in the Church. When we understood, firmly believed in, and obeyed those truths, we became members of the Church where the true Christians belong. 


Based on Philippians 3:20-21 (New Living Translation), when the end comes, which is also when our Savior returns, He will take us with Him and will change our weak mortal bodies into a glorious one like His own. 

That is the reason the Bible says that if we are faithful until the end, we will share in all that belongs to Christ. While we are eagerly waiting for that great day, Apostle James said, in James 5:7-8 (New Life Version), ‚ÄúChristian brothers, be willing to wait for the Lord to come again.‚Äù 

Therefore, we must never forget about waiting for Christ‚Äôs return. We should not shift our attention to worldly things. Hence, according to Second Corinthians 4:18 and 16-17 (New Century Version), let us set our eyes, not on the things that we see, but on what we cannot see. 

What we see here in this world are hardship, troubles, and problems. If we set our eyes on those things, then we might lose courage. Such things will last only a short time. On the other hand, the things we cannot see yet but have faith in and wait for will last forever. 

Those are the eternal life that God promised us, being able to live in the Holy City, and the glorious life that we will experience there. Because the first-century Christians set their eyes on God‚Äôs promises, though their physical bodies became older and weaker, their spirit was made new every day. Let us also do the same so the troubles that we experience will not hinder us but even help us gain eternal glory. To be firm in our conviction and always set our hope on the eternal glory that we will inherit, we are taught in Second Peter 1:19-21 (TLB) to always remember that what the prophets said came true. 

Isn‚Äôt it that the prophecy concerning the time and place of the Church‚Äôs emergence in these last days indeed was fulfilled or came true? And we are witnesses to the fulfilment of God‚Äôs promised help that was mentioned also in the prophecy. Those are proofs that this Church is of God. This Church is the one that will receive salvation and everlasting life. Let us not separate from the truth of the prophecies about this Church and, instead, follow it as a light shining into dark corners.

In First Corinthians 10:9-12 (The Message), the apostles also remind us to ‚Äúbe careful not to stir up discontent‚Äù so we will not end up like the ancient people of Israel. Because of discontent, they complained again and again about the hardships that they experienced. The Lord became so angry with them that He punished them. 

The history of the Israelites was written in the Bible for us not to repeat their mistake that resulted in their divine election going to waste. We should not look back and desire again the sensual pleasures and the materialism of the world from which God has already removed us. 

No one in the nation of God should be found complaining when experiencing hardship and heavy problems. Apostle Paul said, ‚ÄúForget about self-confidence; [because] it‚Äôs useless. Cultivate God-confidence.‚Äù Thus, let us be prayerful. Let us trust that God can easily do even the things that people think are impossible. In Hebrews 12:15-16 (Last Days Bible) God instructs us to ‚Äúalways be continually diligent ... so that none of [us] fall short of receiving God‚Äôs wonderful, undeserved mercy.‚Äù Thus, it is evil to stop and draw back from the duties that God has given us.

 We are also told to be careful of the poisonous teachings that would allow one to lead an unholy life. Thus, let us not listen to false preachers because that is what they teach‚Äîpoisonous teachings that cause the corruption of people‚Äôs faith. Let us also be careful not to get involved in sexual sins. That‚Äôs why we are always reminded by our Executive Minister to fulfill the intensive renewal of life. Let us not imitate Esau who exchanged his inheritance rights as the oldest son for a single meal. 

We should never exchange our inheritance rights as God‚Äôs children for the material things of this world.  Let us never allow ourselves to waste our God-given election. Thus, let us ask Him in our prayer what is stated in Psalm 25:1-5 (Contemporary English Version): 1I offer you my heart, Lord God, 2and I trust you. Don‚Äôt make me ashamed or let enemies defeat me. 3Don‚Äôt disappoint any of your worshipers, but disappoint all deceitful liars. 4Show me your paths and teach me to follow; 5guide me by your truth and instruct me. You keep me safe, and I always trust you. 

May God again strengthen our faith through of the power of the Holy Spirit, which He sends to us whenever we attend the worship service. 

May He help us to uphold the election that we received from Him until the end of our life or until the Second Advent of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

May no one among us be left behind in our journey; instead, may all of us be with God in the Holy City.

During EVM WS we always logged off as soon as the recessional hymn started playing, but now, theyre forcing us to stay longer until the minister tells us we're done. We're not even officers but we are required to attend both opening and closing officers prayer. SMDH. This is too much. As if the long, redundant sermons are not enough. 

They are even dictating us where to sit (ie not in the couch/sofa). They're not just brainwashing the brethren. They are controlling even their actions. last Thursday's WS is all about obeying ""the will of God"" without questioning, complaining and any reservations.

**Prayers**

* Officers' Opening Prayer - 3:48
   * This prayer dedicated 47 seconds (roughly 21% of the prayer) to EVM...
   * ...but only 19 seconds (8%) to Jesus Christ.
* Opening Prayer - 7:53
   * EVM - 1:45 (22%)
   * Jesus - :33 (7%)
* Post-Lesson Prayer - 9:29
   * EVM - 2:05 (22%) NOTE: Take these figures with a grain of salt, because I kept dozing off from this point forward.
   * Jesus- :28 (5%)
* Prayer after Ordination - 5:05
   * EVM - :05 (1.7%) No prayer is complete without a quick plug of EVM!
   * Jesus - :19 (6.3%)
* Officers' Closing Prayer - 1:40
   * Another quick mention of EVM, but no mention of Jesus.

**Hymns**

* Officers' Prayer - 90
* 301 (""Praises to You, Our Almighty God!"")
   * showtune-like hymn with a stanza dedicated to the ""prophecy"" of God's nation
* 394 (""Do Not Grieve the Spirit of the Lord"")
   * obedience/submission hymn
* 437 (""To You, Lord Jesus, I Offer My Heart"")
   * another submission/obedience ""hymn""; they added a descant/first soprano to make this hymn more showy
* 385 (""Father, May You Abide with Us"")
   * Judging by the lyrics and the fact that it first came out around 2015, this hymn seems to be written to scorn the ""detractors"" of the faith.
* Before Text - 362 (""Listen and Put into Practice"")
   * seems somewhat like a showtune, mentions ""those who have the right to proclaim the word of God"" as if any messenger/minister in the INC qualifies
* Recessional - 286

**Sermon**

* Surprise, surprise, the intro consists of milestone celebrations, the mention of upholding our services to God, and how the future will be difficult, and yadda, yadda...
* Deuteronomy 10:12-13, 21
* Nehemiah 9:21
* Exodus 13:21; 14:21-22; 16:4, 13-15
* Deuteronomy 12:11,13-14
* John 4:23
* 1 Chronicles 16:11
* Hebrews 10:25, New Jerusalem
* Repeat Heb. 10:25 in Translation for Translators
* Psalms 34:9 (It would not be a PPV if EVM had his reader re-read the first part of this verse multiple times.)
   * Message
   * Living Bible
   * Expanded Bible
   * Easy to Read
* EVM plugs devotional prayers and encourages/coerces worshipers to do it in the house of worship
* Psalms 138:2-3, 7:8 (EVM asks for another re-reading of the first part of the verse.)
* 2 Samuel 22:7
* When you‚Äôre greatly stressed, you experience depression. When you experience depression, you‚Äôre tempted to do evil. Don‚Äôt do evil. Worship God instead. Or at least that‚Äôs how EVM came across here.
* 2 Chronicles 20:9
* Psalms 145:18-20
* EVM asks those about to be ordained if they truly love the church, and conditions them never to leave the ministry, blah blah blah...
* Psalms 34:8, 4, 9 (Yes, Psalms 34:9 was read FIVE times by this point!)
* Lesson clocked in at \~52 minutes.
* After the closing prayer, an excerpt of the ordination was shown.
* The total WS length was 1 hour, 36 minutes from officers' prayer to officers' prayer, up slightly from the previous 1 hour, 32 minutes
* Of those, nearly 28 minutes were spent on prayers.
   * Of that 28, about 5 were dedicated to EVM, or about 17% of the total praying time.
   * But only 99 seconds, or roughly 6% of the praying time, was spent on Jesus Christ. Surprise surprise, ministers spend roughly 3x longer praying for EVM than for Christ.

EDITS: 2 Samuel 22:7 was also read (and re-read); afterward, EVM claims depression causes a person to do evil; corrected how much overall time EVM got over all 5 prayers",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/joyp2y/weekend_worship_service_examination_nov_06_nov_09/

* *Social Media against The Church* (mentions of socmed)

I don't do detailed reports anymore, but 2 things stuck to me: Bitching about immigration and bitching about culture. Also homophobia. The main lesson was about how ""lucky"" you're an INC, but it seems like those two things stuck to mind because they went on tangents about that.

The first thing was bitching about immigration and how Filipinos / 3rd world country citizens want to move to the USA (as an example). Like seriously, how is that a fucking problem to them. They even mentioned something about like ""Just because you're a US citizen doesn't mean you're a British citizen"". Tell me a sane person, let alone a sane Christian who has proven that. They kept comparing that to ""citizenship in the holy city"".

Next is how they shit on culture and how ""INC does not adjust to other cultures when they expanded to other countries"". They poked on USA's law (or whatever it is) about emacipation (if you're 18+, you're no longer bound to your parents/guardian). ***HOW IS THAT A FUCKING PROBLEM TO THEM? HOW IS THAT A FUCKING BIG DEAL? THEY'RE IN THE FUCKING AGE OF MAJORITY. THERE'S NO NEED FOR THEIR PARENTS/GUARDIAN TO BABY THEM.***

Then there came the fucking relationship-related so-called ""sins"". First they brought up divorce/annulment and the only case they brought up was a what-if case of future incompatibility. Next is live-in partnership because of said incompatibility. Then.. Same-sex marriage!! They said shit about how it's ""a teaching of the devil"".

***IT'S FUCKING 2-0-2-0 AND THIS CULT IS STILL LIKE THIS SHIT. FUCKING HELL. SO WHAT'S NEXT, EXISTING IS NOW A SIN?***

HOUSEHOLD WORSHIP SERVICE
BASED ON THE LESSON OUTLINED
BY BROTHER BIENVENIDO C. SANTIAGO
SATURDAY/SUNDAY: NOVEMBER 14/15, 2020

(Fair Use) Copyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976, allowance is made for ‚Äúfair use‚Äù for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research

THE TRUE HOME AND CITIZENSHIP OF THE MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH OF CHRIST 

Our membership in the Church Of Christ cannot be exchanged for anything that people of this world value. Because of our being chosen by God, we have the right relationship with Him. We received the right to render true worship and the right way to serve Him. God also gave us the privilege to call on Him, and He listens to us when we pray to Him. Most of all, even now we are already certain of receiving salvation on Judgment Day and the promised eternal life with God and with our Lord Jesus Christ.  

We are certain that those blessings are intended for us because as stated in Ephesians 2:19 (New International Version) ‚ÄúYou  are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's household.‚Äù The ones referred to in this verse are those who are in union with Christ, according to Ephesians 2:12-13 (Good News Bible). Even though they used to be separated from Christ, had no part in the covenants, and lived without God in this world, but because of their union with Christ, they were brought near to God through redemption with the blood of Christ. 

Sin caused people to be far away from God. However, when Christ redeemed with His blood the people in the Church Of Christ, according to Acts 20:28 (Lamsa translation), their sins were forgiven and they were brought near to God. Therefore, we, members of the true Church, are the ones who are truly in union with Christ.  We are fellow citizens of God‚Äôs people and members of God‚Äôs household.  

According to John 10:9 (Revised English Bible), there is no discrimination in accepting people in joining the Church Of Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ said ‚Äúanyone who comes into the fold ‚Äùor the Church Of Christ ‚Äúwill be safe.‚Äù Anyone‚Äîregardless of his race, citizenship or nationality, or socio-economic status‚Äîmay come into the Church Of Christ, when he has understood and firmly believed in the gospel preached by those who have the authority to preach.  

Even though the members of the true Church come from different races, according to Galatians 3:26-28 (New Century Version),there is no longer a difference between Jew or Greek, slave and free person, male and female‚Äîwe are all the same in Christ.  

During the time of the apostles, there were Church members who were Jews, Greeks, Romans, Ethiopians, Samaritans, and others. In our time today, members of the Church Of Christ are of different nationalities. According to First Corinthians 12:13 (Bible in Basic English), the Jews or Greeks or people from any other race who were baptized into Christ were formed into one body, the Church Of Christ.  

Hence, it does not matter what our race or citizenship is; as long as we are members of the Church Of Christ, there is no difference between Jew or Greek, Filipino, American, German, Japanese or whatever race and nationality. We are all the same in Christ.

We are no longer foreigners to one another but fellow citizens of God‚Äôs chosen people and members of the household of God. And so, Church members should not get involved in fighting or disputes concerning differences in race, gender, or nationality so the unity of the Church will be preserved.

If there are customs or cultural practices in a Church member‚Äôs country of origin, which do not conform to God‚Äôs teachings that we firmly believe in, we should not be so well-adjusted or conform to such. Instead, according to Romans 12:2 (The Message), we should recognize what God wants or His will, and respond or conform to it. What is according to God‚Äôs will are the things that do not contradict His teachings written in the Bible.

For example, regarding marriage. It is customary in some countries to allow interfaith marriage or marriage between a man and a woman from different religions. There are countries that allow same-sex marriage. There are those that have legalized divorce. There are people who disregard marriage and live together as husband and wife even though unmarried. There are those who are married but are committing adultery.

True Christians should not conform to those because such things are only ‚Äúdragging [people] down to its level of immaturity.‚Äù The advice to us is: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt become so well-adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking.‚Äù Let us fix our attention on God, and we will be changed from the inside out.

Instead of valuing more the culture and customs in our country of origin that are contrary to God‚Äôs will, what we should give higher regard to is our membership in the Church Of Christ for, because of it, our citizenship is in heaven, according to Philippians 3:20 (American Standard Version) The privileges of citizenship in any country in this world, no matter how great or many those privileges may be, can never compare with the graces and blessings that come with our membership in the Church Of Christ and our citizenship in heaven.

During the first century, many people considered it a great benefit to have Roman citizenship because the Roman Empire dominated a large part of the ancient world. In our time, what is considered as a great advantage, especially by people in the so-called ‚ÄúThird World countries,‚Äù is to become a U.S. citizen or British citizen.

Apostle Paul, though a Jew, was a citizen of Tarsus in Cilicia (Acts 21:39) and a Roman citizen by birth (Acts 22:27-28). Nevertheless, what he deemed as a great and wonderful thing is his citizenship in heaven. Thus, he told the members of the Church Of Christ, ‚ÄúOur citizenship is in heaven. 

‚ÄùAccording to Philippians 3:20-21 (English Standard Version), our citizenship as Church Of Christ members is much greater than any citizenship on earth. Nothing else can bring us such great blessings‚Äîsalvation and glory‚Äîother than our citizenship in heaven, which we acquired when God called us into the Church Of Christ.

Righteousness dwells in the Holy City where we shall be brought, according to Second Peter 3:13, unlike in this world where injustice prevails, which is why there are people who are maltreated and killed. There is no one here on earth who has the power to solve all the turmoil, unrest, and injustice in this world. The only one who can put an end to all those things is our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, when He returns to take us with Him to our true home.

In the Holy City, according to Revelation 21:1-4, no one will ever mistreat us and nothing will ever cause us pain and suffering. While here on earth, according to Hebrews13:14, no city is permanent. On Judgment Day, the earth and all the works in it will be burned. So, let us not exchange our membership in the Church Of Christ for anyone or anything in this world.

It was foretold in Job 14:1-2 (New Living Translation) that man‚Äôs life in this world is so frail, short, and full of trouble. People with great intelligence and wealth cannot do anything to change that plight of humanity because God is the One Who decreed it to be so. That is why poverty and hardship remain unsolved. When we, Church Of Christ members, help our fellowmen‚ÄîChurch members and nonmembers alike‚Äîwe do so to somehow lighten the burdens in life of our fellowmen and to let them feel our love and concern for them. 

However, we and anybody else can never solve such problem of humanity. The solution to it will come only when our Lord Jesus Christ returns to bring the ones whom He will save in the Holy City. So, let us share our faith with our fellowmen so they will also be among God‚Äôs chosen people, the ones whom God considers His children whose citizenship is in heaven.

In First Peter 2:11 (Darby Translation)& 12 (International Children‚Äôs Bible),the apostles exhort us that while we are sojourning or temporarily residing in this world and journeying towards our true home, we should live good lives amidst people who do not believe so they will see the good things we do, not for our own glory but for the glory of God.

That‚Äôs why, Brother Eduardo Manalo frequently reminds us to completely renew our lives and obey the commands of God because our Executive Minister wants all of us to reach heaven, because our citizenship is there. If we truly have faith in that promise of God, we should strive to be good citizens who abide by the supreme law‚ÄîGod‚Äôs laws and decrees.

If we experience difficulties as we sojourn in this world, let us consider it as our sharing in the sufferings of our Lord Jesus Christ. When we are able to do that, according to First Peter 4:12-13 (Modern English Version), we will rejoice and be fully glad when His glory is revealed. On His Second Advent, He will transform our mortal body into a glorious body, like His.
May that be our inspiration in our journey in this world. No matter what we encounter, let us stand firm and strong in our membership in the Church Of Christ so we can uphold it until the end and fully benefit from it.

**Other Stray Thoughts/Remarks/Tangents**:

* Why is it we only sing higher-numbered hymns (the ones not included in the hymnal) during these PPVs (aside from holy supper/thanksgiving)? Is this the administration of making PPVs special?
* Barring choir members, anyone even remember the aforementioned higher-numbered hymns (hence why I put the titles and tried to describe them)?
* More and more hymns have been getting descants/first soprano lines. I guess this is to make the hymns more majestic/spiritual to those who still believe. To me, all this does is make the brainwashing content of the hymns easier to enter the minds of those who haven't yet awakened.
* EVM calls out anyone who relinquished their duty/ies or even their INC membership. So...like thousands of brethren, possibly more?
* Considering how much EVM shuffles verses, I wonder how good he is at shuffling cards.
* And WHY does EVM keep making his reader repeat certain parts of verses so much? Does he really think we're a bunch of preschoolers & kindergarteners?
* EVM mentions a catholic priest that committed suicide because he supposedly ""LoSt HoPe.""
* ""It's bad to be discouraged/disheartened."" ‚ÄîMr. Manalo, 2020
* Of course EVM would mention offerings, even if it's just a quick mention.
* ""These are not my words. If they were, don't believe them."" Well, there we have it! Mr. ~~Monopoly~~ Manalo himself said it, and he wonders why so many have stopped believing.
* EVM claims not to want anyone to suffer or be cursed. Would that include his family members whom he expelled for supposedly TrYiNg To CaUsE dIvIsIoN?
* I love how there are times when one ""Tuloy!"" happens maybe 2-3 seconds after the previous. See? He doesn't even trust his reader! If that's the case, why doesn't he himself read? If he did, would he still say things like ""Tuloy"" mid-sentence?
* ""If we didn't have God's promise, then what is happening to other religions would also have happened to us."" Oh, the lack of self-awareness!
* I noticed that (at least in my region) the head honchos (aka monitors, hosts, backup hosts, and gatekeepers) removed the ability for brethren to unmute their mics. If that weren't the case, I can only imagine someone ""accidentally"" unmuting him/herself and screaming, ""Hurry up already!"" (or its Tagalog translation or similar) 7 or so minutes into the nearly-11 minute closing prayer.

Another 2 weeks, another video streaming forced down our throats. How do I make it through these things? When I'm alone, like I was this time and last time, I:

* lip-sync the hymns
* type up this report during the ""lesson""
* scroll through the participants list to see people I know
* try to find people not singing so I can gauge whether or not I myself should sing or even lip-sync
* play hearts/spades/solitaire
* go onto the Internet
* daydream/wonder why there isn't a ""tl; dr"" button for these ""worship services""
* doodle in my journal if I have it

When I'm with other people, I make sure to bring my journal so I can still doodle/pretend to take notes when really I'm writing stuff for my report. Of course, just because I'm with others doesn't mean I stop dozing off.

Finally, please do not hesitate to add to parts that are incomplete/missing, and please correct anything I got wrong.

I honestly pity the priest, he might‚Äôve been mentally ill but instead of having sympathy, EVM says that a spiritual leader should be there to lead instead of being consummated by the woes of this world. Ughhh, spiritual leader or not, we are all prone to mental illness. Fast check, EVM, you show signs of narcissism, so doesn‚Äôt it relinquish your **title** to lead the false flock?

So apparently God will reward/punish each person according to his/her conduct. What about the parents who got punished for their children‚Äôs misdeeds?

Do ministers have contests on whoever can mention EVM and/or the administration the most?

‚ÄúTake care of the flock willingly‚Äù (or something to that effect). How many officers are doing this even slightly willingly and not from coercion? Also, ministerial worker whatchamacallit says, ‚ÄúTake care of yourself before you can take care of others.‚Äù Maybe then get down to WHY many brethren feel unmotivated and don‚Äôt believe?

Or at least half of your members, the other half of us understand that this is a greedy corporation who's sole purpose is to make money off of those who are already struggling in exchange for false information and a shot of hope twice a week. But, we can't say shit because we risk losing our family life.

What makes me equally angry is that it is slowly making my heard black. I used to wish that these lies would simply be uncovered and the members go on to be real Christians for God and not the Manalos.

"Weekend Worship Service Examination (Dec 18 - Dec 21, 2020)",kfeei1,2020-12-17,"**Hymns (and My Personal Comments)**

* 344 (Officers' Prayer)
   * I'll be honest here...this hymn was the best one in today's service (not that that's saying very much, as you'll soon see). Short & sweet, no idolatry to the administration.
* 325
   * showtune, sounds like 2-3 different hymns spliced together, hard-to-follow rhythm in first half
   * This hymn has a descant (first soprano) to make the hymn sound more ear-pleasing so the message will hopefully infiltrate the average worshiper's mind easily.
* 504
   * the obligatory hymn whose theme revolves around whatever campaign/slogan the administration churned out
   * There's a part about living in fervor/diligence and upholding your election...pardon me while I vomit somewhere...
   * Another part that gets me is the part about ""He has never abandoned his own."" So I guess every bad thing that happened to an insider is supposedly just a test, but every bad thing that happened to an outsider is completely warranted?
   * This hymn also has a descant. Woe to any voluntold first-sopranos (or even altos)
* 250
   * I've said it before and I'll say it again...this newer revision doesn't come anywhere close to as good as the pre-2013 revision! Why? The first half is all about duty and being true to it. The second half is just an inferior remnant of what the old hymn once was.
* Processional
   * Blessings can only be found in the true church, so never leave it. Repeat for 6 verses (plus an intro and outro) and a chorus repeated 3x
   * And of course, there's a mention of the ""Leader"" (yes, capital ""L,"" like the one the administration should just take) in the 5th stanza as a subliminal kiss-up to you-know-who.
* 505 (Before Text)
   * Never doubt or waver.
   * ""We won't stray nor be deceived."" So then what is the current administration doing? Are they not deceiving us in ways like saying, ""ThErE's No CoRrUpTiOn In ThE cHuRcH,"" or, ""NeVeR lIsTeN tO tHe DeTrAcToRs""?
* The doxology, as you may have noticed in recent PPVs, has *at least* 6 voices: the regular SATB, first soprano/descant, and first tenor. How long before the doxology becomes a full-on Broadway-type score much like many other hymns?
* 425 (Recessional)
   * I'm pretty sure, ""Never Tire of Doing What Is Good"" was a previous campaign of the administration.
   * The instrumental accompaniment does not complement the vocals at all. Whoever said, ""Yup, sounds good!"" must've been a yes-person trying to please the music department.

**Other Comments & Observations**

* As usual as of recent, no offertory hymn (Thank God \[assuming he exists\]. Anything to shorten these PPVs).
* Predictably, the sermon is about giving many thanks in the form of monetary offerings to God.
* Manalo says, ""These are not my words. If they are, don't believe them,"" then wonders why fewer brethren believe as the days elapse.
* Manalo mentions the Macedonians and how they abounded in their offerings in an attempt to guilt trip us into giving more.
* Ah, the good ol' shuffling of verses to suit the INC narrative.
* I wonder if EVM has ever considered being a pop music singer, considering how repetitive he is.
* I guess Manalo had to shorten his lesson ever so slightly to accommodate the longer ""prayers""/wailing sessions/kiss-up-to-the-leader sessions.
* In case the hymns didn't say it enough, Manalo instructs us yet again to ""UpHoLd OuR mEmBeRsHiPs""!
* Oh, ministers. You just couldn't go even one prayer without mentioning the ""beloved leader,"" could you? You also had to make sure Christ still got less time than your ""leader,"" didn't you?
* You minsters also just can't keep your words few, can you?
* Manalo flaunts the supposed victories of the church, even claiming that to list them all would take until the next WS. Maybe if the next WS was like 10 minutes away or less, I guess.
* Manalo throws shade at those not in the ""TrUe ReLiGiOn.""
* If only I had attended by myself in my own room. However, my parents decided to attend the same service I did (Tagalog with English prayer instead of Full Tagalog) and wanted me in the same room as them, hence all the approximations in the prayer timings.

Household Worship Service Saturday/Sunday: December 26/27, 2020

IT IS AN UTTER DISRESPECT TO GOD TO GIVE HIM OFFERINGS THAT ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS WILL

Recently, we conducted our year-end Thanksgiving to God, during which we also brought our thank offerings. We firmly believe in what the Bible teaches that God is well-pleased with such offerings. That is why in our worship service now, we will start preparing our offerings for our Thanksgiving next year. For us to be able to save up prudently and to prepare carefully our offerings for the next Year-End ThanksgivingÔÇæfor they are holy and consecrated for GodÔÇæwe save and set them aside through the local congregation where we are registered. 

In doing so, we are motivated by our understanding and faith that what we do is in accordance with God‚Äôs will. We want to please God and not anger Him; to glorify Him and not to disrespect or dishonor Him. So, let us not be like those who, although they were among God‚Äôs people and gave their offerings, committed an utter disrespect to God, instead of glorifying Him. 

The kind of offering that is an utter disrespect to God and does not glorify Him is like what the ancient nation of Israel did. In God‚Äôs pronouncement in Malachi 1:6-7, it is clear that He was angry with the leaders of ancient Israel because they despised His Name, instead of honoring, respecting, and having reverent fear of Him. Instead of glorifying Him, they utterly disrespected Him. 

So, God told them: ‚ÄúYou offer defiled food on My altar.‚Äù They also gave offerings to God. However, God was not pleased with their offering and, instead, became angry with them because they offered defiled food. That was an utter disrespect to God.

During the time of the ancient nation of Israel, among the sacrifices that they offered were animals from their flock. In Malachi 1:8, God faulted them for offering sacrifices with defects‚Äîanimals that are blind, lame, or sick‚Äîwhich even their  govern or would neither be pleased with nor accept. Thus, it was an utter disrespect to God to offer to Him animals that even humans would not find acceptable. Such offerings are defiled and unacceptable to Him.

God is great, according to Malachi1:11, so a pure offering should be offered for His name.
That is the reason we completely and faithfully prepare our offerings or voluntary contributions. We set aside an amount from the blessings we receive from God. We do not offer to God merely what was left over from our expenses. And because of our high regard for the One to Whom we give or offer, we make it sure that we offer money that are presentable or in good condition. 

Another kind of offering that is an utter disrespect to God is to offer ‚Äúwhat has been taken by violence,‚Äùaccording to Malachi 1:13 (English Standard Version).In the Amplified Bible, the equivalent of that is ‚Äútaken by robbery, ‚Äùand in the New King James Version, ‚Äústolen.‚Äù Offering something that came from illegal means is not pleasing to God. Such kind of offerings, along with those that have defects (such as offerings that were not prepared beforehand or money that are in poor condition),will not be accepted by God.

Thus, let us respond to the call of the Church Administration to completely renew our lives. Let us make sure that we earn our living through righteous means. Any amount obtained from illegal, unlawful, wicked, or corrupt meansÔÇæfor example, that which is stolenÔÇæare not pleasing to God. Rather, He considers such offerings as an utter disrespect to Him. Thus, we should have the right understanding of what giving is, what thank offerings are, and how we should give or offer. Psalm50:14says:Offer to God thanksgiving, And pay your vows to the Most High. 

We should regard the giving of thank offerings to God as a holy or sacred thing. It is a vow or a solemn promise to the Lord. And according to Numbers30:2, when a person makes a vow to God, he binds his soul to an agreement. The strict instruction to anyone who makes a vow to God is, ‚ÄúHe shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth. ‚ÄùAnd according to Ecclesiastes5:4-5, ‚ÄúWhen you make a vow to God, do not delay to pay it ... Pay what you have vowed.‚Äù Before we were baptized in the Church Of Christ, one of the doctrines taught to us, which we must fulfill, is to render thanks giving to God with offerings. 

We took an oath before God that we would fulfill it. We are not dictated on the amount to offer; instead, according to what our heart purposes, we ourselves decide on how much we will offer to God when we give thanks to Him. 

Thus, let be devoted to fulfilling it. Let us imitate the devotion of the first-century Christians in preparing their Thanksgiving offerings to God. According to Second Corinthians 9:1-2 and 5, Achaia was ready for a whole year. Let us also prove to God that we value and are devoted to preparing our thank offerings.  Let us prepare them for a whole year, ‚ÄúThat it may be ready as a matter of generosity and not as a grudging obligation.‚Äù 

Thus, we should save up weekly for our annual Thanksgiving by setting aside through the finance office in our local congregation.  We should not delay or forsake it. Instead, we should give importance and fulfill it in accordance with God‚Äôs will.

This is what is taught in Second Corinthians9:7:So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.  

The giving of offerings or voluntary contributions in accordance with God‚Äôs will can be done as follows: First, ‚Äúlet each one give.‚Äù Thus, all should give offerings. The number of brethren in a local congregation should also be the number of those who will give their offerings or voluntary contributions. Second, ‚Äúgive as he purposes in his heart.‚Äù Heart symbolizes love. Therefore, the giving of offerings or voluntary contributions should be motivated by love. One who loves God is not tight-fisted or does not feel as if it were a waste to offer. Third, ‚ÄúGod loves a cheerful giver.‚Äù

Isn‚Äôt it that our happiness overflows when, in our Thanksgiving, we are able to give the amount that we have set on ourselves to give as our offering, according to what our heart purposes? Such a giver is the one whom God loves.  Thus, let us be devoted to our duty to give offerings to God, even to our setting aside for our Year-End Thanksgiving. We will again do that to preparef or the Year-End Thanksgiving next year.

Before we pray,we will sing ‚ÄúI Am A Member Of The Church Of Christ‚Äù

"Weekend Worship Service Examination (Jan 01 - Jan 04, 2021)",ko57xz,2020-12-31,"Again they use incorrect statistics to try to prove their point.  They said other religions are unable to worship due to government restrictions and that we should be thankful that we're able to worship on WebEx.  Wait what???  Other religions have moved their worship services online and do it better than the INC so stop trying to act like INC are the only ones capable of holding online worship services.  Another statistic they try to assume is that all members are excited to go back to the chapel.  I guarantee that not all members are OWE and not all members want to go back.  I dread the day things return to normal and I can do without going back to that awful place full of judgmental individuals.

Other incorrect thoughts during this playback goes to the end is near part.  They claim that there are more earthquakes happening per day, but that's completely false.  We only have more advanced instruments that can measure these earthquakes, nothing has changed in the amount of seismic activity according to scientific publications.  Do you really think the advancement of instruments for measuring seismic activity would halt?  Science is always advancing forward.

He also talked about social media and misinformation.  He said not to listen or trust everything you read online.  He said that people who are gullible are children and they say INC members are the children of God so that must mean they're gullible?  This is a tongue in cheek comment and I say it this way because that's how INC likes to twist words.  Of course don't assume everything you read online is fact, you should ALWAYS do your own research and use multiple sources to verify the truth.  That's why I don't believe or trust this church.

Of course, as an awakened individual the cult's logical inconsistencies against the RCC now stick out like a sore thumb.

The Inquisition is an admittedly dark stain on the Vatican's history, and is one of the reasons why I personally find no solace in spirituality. The premise that drove the Inquisition is alluded to by the Bible, and it is also what pushes militant INC members to do unsavory deeds. However, what INC fails to mention is that the Inquisition targeted what the RCC considered as paganic and apostatic, which included (but is not limited to) ""witches"", Protestant precursors, as well as other splinter groups that arose from the Catholic Church. Unless INC acknowledges itself as a Protestant sect, Central has no historical leverage to consider itself or its believers as a victim of the Papal Inquisition.

INC determines far east based on a modern map of the world, but if we were to just move the map then you can change what is actually the far east.  When EGM went to Hawaii, did he travel all the way west to reach the far west or did he travel east? He traveled east to get to Hawaii so shouldn't far east and west be relative to the location of the verse described in the Bible?

Also, a prophecy fulfilled by EGM traveling to Hawaii is a little ridiculous.  No one is preventing him from traveling and making a local.  If you read a prophecy and you try to fulfill it, it doesn't mean that you are the fulfillment of said prophecy.

Welcome to episode...uh, does anyone know? I lost count...in 2016. Anyhoo, here's a basic, informal outline:

* 30 minutes before the hour, hymn 200 is sung. Following that is the officers' prayer, this one lasting about 6 minutes. Of course, Manalo is mentioned extensively throughout the ""prayer.""
* A single prelude plays (I forgot which one it is) before the ""hymns"" are sung. In order:
   * 310
   * 500: ""The Only Proper Response as the LORD'S True Chosen Ones""
   * 402: ""There Will Never Be Room For Doubt""
      * I think those titles speak for themselves. \*rolls eyes\*
   * 132
* We stand up and endure another 6 minute prayer. Can you guess who gets a good chuck of this prayer? Also mentioned is an ordination, which means an extra prayer after the so-called ""closing"" prayer.
* The before sermon hymn is 398, titled ""Hold Onto The Words Of God""
   * This hymn has the lyric ""always obey"" and mentions the Administration (Capital ""A"" of course!). EDIT: The Messenger is also mentioned. \*rolls eyes again\*
* 4 minutes before the top of the hour and Manalo starts his lecture, as always starting with locale anniversaries.
* Since this PPV includes an ordination, Manalo exhorts the other young males in attendance to consider joining the ministry.
* The following verses are read (and unless I'm mistaken, no translations were ever mentioned \[I wonder why\]):
   * Psalms 31:10
   * Psalms 13:2
   * Zephaniah 1:17
   * Psalms 42:11
   * Isaiah 40:31
   * II Corinthians 12:9‚Äì10
   * Deuteronomy 31:8
   * II Corinthians 10:12
   * Philippians 4:12‚Äì13
   * John 16:33
   * I Peter 5:10, 7
* Some of Manalo's comments can be paraphrased as:
   * Don't be sad or depressed, because those are bad.
   * Flinching and cowardice, likewise, are bad.
   * Social media and the Internet are bad (unless you're using them to ~~trick~~ convert people!). You should instead approach your officers and ministers, for they are approachable, even when they're not.
   * ""Put (y)our hope in the grace that will be (y)ours,"" in case you somehow haven't heard it 1,048,576 times by now.
   * Brethren, I pray for \[spiel goes here\].
* Manalo's sermon wraps up 10 minutes before the top of the next hour, for a sermon length of 54 minutes.
* During those 54 minutes, I count 42 instances of ""TuLoY!"" or about a ""TuLoY!"" every minute and 18 seconds.
* The post-lesson prayer spans about 7 minutes. You-know-who is prayed for once again.
   * Granted it's not as long as some of the previous closing/post-lesson prayers were (I'm looking at you, minister who prayed 14 minutes \[and 25 seconds\] last Year-End Thanksgiving!), but...can't they keep it at 5 minutes or shorter? Or is that really asking for too much?
* The brethren are seated, and we watch a snippet of the ordination. Hymn 165 plays in the background.
* Don't get too comfortable! Please stand for a 5 minute prayer (give or take), of which Manalo gets...I don't know exactly how much, but it's still too much!
* Thankfully this segues to the doxology and benediction.
* Now we take a breather and sit while the recessional, hymn 425, plays.
* After a \~2 minute officers' prayer (Do I even need to say who gets mentioned here?), and 7 minutes after the top of the hour, the PPV finally ends, clocking in at 1 hour and 37 minutes, or about a minute shorter than last PPV's 1 hour and 38 minutes.
   * The prayers total to roughly 26 minutes, roughly the same as last PPV.

**Other Comments**

* Manalo's reader always looks irritated (or is it just me?). I'd be irritated too if I were interrupted every 2 or 3 seconds.
* As you can see, I'm experimenting with a new layout. If you prefer my previous layout, or you have other suggestions, please let me know and I'll see what I can do! :D

2. Talks about the causes of sadness, one of which is because of our sins that's why we are experiencing His wrath. 
3. This is gold. He said something like the it's bad to compare ourselves to others (?). Like if we have problems, we should seek the officers/ministers in the church, and pray to God. Rather than seeking answers to internet/social media. And I was like waiting if he will mention about reddit.
4. For OWEs, it seems like this is more of ""pagpapalakas ng kaluluwa"" or strengthening our faith.. but I still couldn't feel it.

BROTHER FELIX MANALO IS GOD‚ÄôS MESSENGER IN THE LAST DAYS

We firmly believe that the Church to which we belong is the Church that truly belongs to God and to Christ because the one who preached about it‚ÄîBrother Felix Manalo‚Äîis a messenger of God. Through his preaching of God‚Äôs words taught by Christ, the Church Of Christ was re-established by Christin these last days. We will review today the reason we are certain that God sent a messenger in the last days and the proof that Brother Felix Manalo is God‚Äôs messenger.

In the Christian era, God sends messengers through biblical prophecies. The testimony that John the Baptist gave that he was a messenger of God was the prophecy of God written in the book of Prophet Isaiah proclaimed hundreds of years before John was born. It was not the name ‚ÄúJohn the Baptist‚Äù that was written in the prophecy but the work that God had appointed him to fulfill. John the Baptist proved that he was a messenger of God when he proclaimed in John 1:19-23 (Good News Bible) that the prophecy of Isaiah concerning ‚Äúthe voice shouting in the desert‚Äù referred to him and was fulfilled in him.

The greatest Messenger, our Lord Jesus Christ, proved in the same manner that He was sent by God. It was recorded in Luke 4:16-21 (GNB) that He read the prophecy about His work or mission written also in the book of Isaiah, which states, ‚ÄúThe Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has chosen Me to bring good news ... He has sent Me to ... announce that the time has come when the Lord will save His people.‚Äù The Name of Christ was also not mentioned in the prophecy about Him. And Christ Himself said that He was the One being prophesied when He said, ‚ÄúThis passage of scripture has come true today, as you heard it being read.‚Äù

The prophecy attesting to Apostle Paul‚Äôs being sent by God is written also in the book of Prophet Isaiah, as mentioned in Acts 13:46-47. The book states about his work: ‚ÄúI have set you as a light to the Gentiles.‚Äù This prophecy of Prophet Isaiah did not mention as well the name of Apostle Paul. And, likewise, the apostle himself also proclaimed that the prophecy was fulfilled in him because he was the one who was to understand what the Scripture was saying. God sent Apostle Paul when our Lord Jesus Christ was in heaven already. Therefore, it is not true that God‚Äôs sending of messengers was only up to the time when Christ was still here on earth.

There is also a prophecy in the book of Prophet Isaiah about God‚Äôs sending of Brother Felix Manalo as His Messenger. This is written in Isaiah 46:11: Calling a bird of prey from the east, The man who executes My counsel, from a far country. Indeed I have spoken it; I will also bring it to pass. I have purposed it; I will also do it.

The one being prophesied is not a literal bird of prey because the one being prophesied was a man who would execute God‚Äôs counsel. It was specified which east he would come from‚Äînot the Near East or Middle East where the messengers of God from ancient times had come from, but Far East. We have proven in our previous lessons that the Philippines, where Brother Felix Manalo began to preach, is in the Far East. 

According to Isaiah 46:11-13, God would use the messenger who was likened to a bird of prey to bring His righteousness near so people who are far from it will be saved. God‚Äôs righteousness, according to Romans 1:16-17, is the gospel, which ‚Äúis the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes.‚Äù Therefore, the prophesied messenger would be God‚Äôs instrument in His work of salvation.  

Brother Felix Manalo was likened to a bird of prey because, according to the prophecy in Isaiah 43:5-6, the people in the Far East to whom God sent him were being held back by the ‚Äúnorth‚Äù and the ‚Äúsouth.‚Äù The ‚Äúnorth‚Äù represents Protestantism and the ‚Äúsouth‚Äù Catholicism. 

On pages 72 and 48 of the book Europe (in Theory), it is stated that the Christian religion was divided into Catholic and Protestant, in the 18th century. The people of the north embraced Protestantism, while those of the south adhered still to Catholicism.

On page 745 of The Encyclopedia of World Religions, it is stated that even in America, the north is predominantly Protestant and the south is predominantly Catholic. The ones who brought Catholicism to the Philippines, were the Spaniards, citizens of Spain, a country in southern Europe. Those who brought Protestantism to the Philippines came from North America‚Äîthe Americans who occupied the Philippines after the Spaniards.

The Catholic Church and Protestantism are the two dominant religions in the Philippines even before Brother Felix Manalo began preaching. It is from those religions that they would bring people out.

Bringing people out of Protestantism (or the north) and Catholicism (or the south) is equivalent to snatching them out and saving them from the punishment by fire, according to Jude 1:23 (GNB). The messenger would bring near to them God‚Äôs righteousness or would preach to them the true gospel. What the prophecy stated about the mission that Brother Felix Manalo would carry out were all fulfilled. 

According to the prophecy in Isaiah 43:5, God would bring and gather the people who accepted and firmly believed in the teachings preached by God‚Äôs Messenger in the last days. In John 6:44, our Lord Jesus Christ said that no one can come to Him unless drawn or brought by God to Him, and He will raise them up at the last day or on Judgment Day. Christ would make them into one flock, as stated in John 10:16. The flock is the Church Of Christ, according to Acts 20:28 (Lamsa translation). Therefore, the other sheep of Christ whom God would bring to Him through the Messenger will be made by Christ into the Church Of Christ. And so, it is the Lord Jesus Christ Who established the Church Of Christ in these last days, through prophecy.

A messenger is still needed for the gospel to be preached because God gave the right to preach only to His messenger, based on Romans 10:14-15. Just because a person has attained a high level of education or is a skilled speaker does not mean that such person has the right to preach. That person needs to prove first that he is a messenger of God because one who is not sent by God does not have the right to preach the gospel. Moreover, the words of God cannot be preached by anyone who is not sent by Him because the Bible is kept secret or hidden in mystery, according to Romans 16:25. And so, even if those who are not sent by God study it, they will never understand it. However, it is to the messenger that God gave the gift of understanding it.

The authority of Brother Felix Manalo to preach the words of God is based on the prophecies that prove that he was sent by God, which were all fulfilled in him: the prophesied place and time of his emergence; the prophesied mission that he would execute‚Äîthe snatching out from the fire people who are in false religions by bringing near to them the righteousness and salvation of God; and God‚Äôs bringing to Christ of people who will firmly believe in his preaching, and Christ, in turn, will bring them to be in the one flock or Church Of Christ.

Also fulfilled in Brother Felix Manalo are God‚Äôs promises and testimony stated in the prophecy in Isaiah 41:9-10 (KJV2000):

You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called you from its chief men, and said unto you, you are my servant; I have chosen you, and not cast you away. Fear not; for I am with you: be not dismayed; for I am your God: I will strengthen you; yea, I will help you; yea, I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness.

In this prophecy, God proclaimed His testimonies and promises to Brother Felix Manalo, His Messenger whom He took and elected from the ends of the earth. God attested that He is the One Who called and chose His Messenger and that He is the God of this servant of His. For this reason, God exhorted him to be neither afraid nor dismayed because He is with him. God said that He would strengthen, help, and uphold him with the right hand of His righteousness.


God fulfilled all these promises to Brother Felix Manalo. It is very evident how God has helped and strengthened the result of the work that he began. The Church has grown and spread throughout the world. Its membership has increased, and the number of Church Officers has risen. It has produced many ministers and ministerial workers. Those who contend with the work of God‚Äôs Messenger have not hindered it from reaping victories. Before God laid to rest Brother Felix Manalo, the Church Of Christ was firmly established in the Philippines already.

God has been with this holy mission and has upheld it not only when Brother Felix Manalo administered the Church but also when Brother Era√±o Manalo administered it, and until now that it is being administered by Brother Eduardo Manalo.  The ever-increasing strength and victory of the Church Of Christ are the work of God and the fulfillment of His promise. 

These solid testimonies concerning the divine calling and authority of Brother Felix Manalo are the basis that we hold on to in recognizing him as the Messenger of God in the last days. Because of God‚Äôs commissioning of him, we are now members of the true Church, the ones who are truly of God and of Christ, having the right to render true service and worship, and the hope to be saved and to inherit God‚Äôs promises.

A bible verse was mentioned..

Ergh, this is what I don't get. Like bruh, God even commanded that we should love our parents because it is the first commandment of God and then you will tell me this kind of thing? Is God double standard or what?

"Weekend Worship Service Examination (Feb 13 - Feb 16, 2021)",liso8o,2021-02-12,"Here are some of the notes I made while listening to this lesson and my thoughts:

* They claim that INC members are heavily persecuted and that the world hates the INC.
   * Most of the world doesn't even know about the INC so how could they hate the INC?  I think persecution should be defined because I've never experienced any persecution while still being in the INC.  There are people who question the teachings, but I feel like the only ones who actually get offended are the ones who really can't defend or speak about their religion because they lack that knowledge or deep understanding.  I also think they get offended because of a deep realization that what those ""persecutors"" are asking about are true.  Someone asked me a question about the INC and also asked how the church would fair with EGM gone, but that is a far cry from being ""heavily persecuted"".
* They mentioned that INC is persecuted because their church has the name of Christ in it.
   * I'm a little dumbfounded by this one.  Naming one's church or religion isn't dependent on any set rules.  We have a Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster so I'm pretty sure there aren't any laws banning what you can name a church.
* They went on to warn Bible students that they should be ready or prepared to be persecuted and that we should be glad that we are being persecuted because it shows that what was read in the Bible about the true servants being persecuted as being true.
   * This is a head scratcher for me yet again.  I still don't see where this persecution is coming from especially when it's those who are just questioning the religion looking for legitimate answers.
* Those who join the INC will be persecuted by their loved ones and we should stand firm against that.
   * It's actually the complete opposite and the experiences posted here are evidence to that.  The INC breaks up families when someone just wants to leave or doesn't want to be in the church.  Those who want to leave are persecuted by their families because that's just the INC way.
* They said people who do not want to join the INC don't want to be ashamed then goes on to ask if we should be ashamed.  And that we shouldn't be ashamed because we are Christians and it means that we would be ashamed of Jesus Christ.
   * What?  I don't think I've met anyone who says, ""shame on you for believing in Jesus Christ"" or ""shame on you for being a Christian"".  All of my non-INC friends don't really care what your religion is, but they'll respect it.
* They asked if we stand to lose anything if we suffer for following Christ and those who suffer will be rewarded with eternal life.
   * What sufferings are they referring to?? Being questioned about their teachings?  People saying no, they don't want to attend your EVM or bible study?  Or those who critically examine the teachings of the INC and find cherry picking verses and fallacies within?

My own summary of the lesson.  The INC wants their members to believe that they're being heavily persecuted by the whole world.  They want them to believe that they're also going through some type of suffering and staying inside the INC is the only way to receive salvation.  The truth of the matter is that the INC persecutes the rest of the world.  We've seen that in their religion bashing lessons.  We've also seen families become torn apart because someone doesn't want to follow their beliefs any longer.  If we exchanged every time they said ""world"" with ""INC"" during this lesson, then I think it would have been a truer lesson.",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/liso8o/weekend_worship_service_examination_feb_13_feb_16/

Some ministers are good in public speaking; I enjoy mentally sparring with them. Others are boring and make 5 minutes seem like an hour.

>Romans 5:2, Hebrews 11:6, John 6:25-26

Come on, Central. Let's be honest here. How many of your ""loyal sheep"" are in INC that isn't because of faith? If the Bible is explicit about nonbelievers who follow for gain or convenience, why keep demonizing *handogs* who simply cannot find it in themselves have faith in the INC? I thought potential converts are always told to ""listen to the doctrines, but do not feel compelled to join if you don't believe them""?

Let me cite again the phrase used by the minister verbatim *ang nasa loob ng Iglesia na nakikisama lang sa asawa, sa anak,* ***sa magulang***\*, sa kamag-anak, sa nagpapatrabaho ay hindi ganap na sumasampalataya\*

>John 3:18, Revelations 21:8

These verses are why the concept of a loving God *is complete utter dogshit.* If his love is truly boundless and unconditional, why would he send me to damnation just because I didn't subscribe to his subjective application of faith? That's not benevolent, that's a tyrant for fuck's sake.

What do scholars say about Acts 20:28 Lamsa translation???  Can we do an examination of this verse and translation then reference what scholars have to say about this as well?

They also mentioned that Jesus's name wasn't mentioned in reference to John 1:1, 14 so it couldn't have been him.  I don't see FYM's name mentioned in the Bible so let's just stop trying to form these kinds of arguments.

Lastly, barely any translations were mentioned again.  I'm guessing this was a commandment from EVM to stop mentioning translations.  Never have i ever heard them explain the different types of translations.  I had to go out and learn about the difference in translations on my own.

* ""Who cares if the world is undergoing a pandemic? Who cares about the current economy? I don't, so give me money!"" says the Manalo.
* Couldn't the minister/worker just read the title and lead the closing prayer to save 30+ minutes (1 hour+ for some locales)? If only it worked that way...
* ""God loves a cheerful giver,"" even though I'm sure the administration would much rather receive a large sum from less-than-pleased brethren than a small sum from truly-cheerful brethren.
   * They might as well have said, ""The administration loves an abundant giver, so keep giving or the finance department will have a word with you.""
* Nope. I still don't understand the rampant use of ""constantly"" in the so-called hymns (45).
* Maybe the hymns would've been ever-so-slightly better if 150 was placed before 133? Then again, most likely not (WHY did my worker not stand on 133? That hymn, at the very least, mentioned Jesus even if the refrain wasn't really about Him.).
* Well, at least the hymns help show the true nature of this ""church.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/ltfqak/weekend_worship_service_examination_feb_27_mar_02/
"Weekend Worship Service Examination (Feb 27 - Mar 02, 2021)",ltfqak,2021-02-26,"It is a commandment and it is your responsibility to give your voluntary offering.  

voluntary -  proceeding from the will or from one's own choice or consent;  acting or done of one's own free will without valuable consideration or legal obligation.

They also mentioned that offering should not be given based on compulsion.  If this were true, then why are people being called out or approached for not giving or even not giving enough?  If they want to make this truly voluntary, then do away with all that and also do away with tracking everyone's offering.  

Don't track who gave what or how much they gave.  Do away with the local/district offering envelopes and just leave a box.  Do away with setting aside every week for the Thanksgiving offering and let your members just save up on their.

Wait?? What's that? What if the bank burns down with your money because we've heard this insane argument? Then thank goodness the bank is insured to cover lost funds. Thank goodness large banks have other branches you can go to for your funds. When you're traveling and need cash, do you go back home to your bank to get money or do you just use the nearest ATM machine?",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/ltfqak/weekend_worship_service_examination_feb_27_mar_02/

"Weekend Worship Service Examination (Feb 27 - Mar 02, 2021)",ltfqak,2021-02-26,Offerings! Offerings!! Count how many times they said the bible verse 2 Corinthians 9:7.. and Hello Macedonians! Lmao,https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/ltfqak/weekend_worship_service_examination_feb_27_mar_02/
"Weekend Worship Service Examination (Feb 27 - Mar 02, 2021)",ltfqak,2021-02-26,"The minister opened with, ‚ÄúWe do not give offering to anyone on earth, but to God in heaven.‚Äù

Now, I read the comments here before the service so tried to remain unbiased. I still came to the same conclusions. 

Let me preface by also saying, this lesson was a complete mess. It was completely disorganized and distracted. It was hard to follow going back and forth and back again, but I digress.

Hebrews 13:15-16 NKJV
‚ÄúTherefore by Him let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His name. But do not forget to do good and to share, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.‚Äù

This verse doesn‚Äôt specifically say to give to the church. Hearing this verse and reading many other translations, it sounds like giving to those who need it.

Further.. the minister eventually went on to:

II Corinthians‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠9:12-13‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NKJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨
‚ÄúFor the administration of this service not only supplies the needs of the saints, but also is abounding through many thanksgivings to God, while, through the proof of this ministry, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal sharing with them and all men,‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠
For easier translation:

2 Corinthians‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠9:12-13‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠CEV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨
‚ÄúWhat you are doing is much more than a service that supplies God's people with what they need. It is something that will make many others thank God. The way in which you have proved yourselves by this service will bring honor and praise to God. You believed the message about Christ, and you obeyed it by sharing generously with God's people and with everyone else.‚Äù

Again, it seems like the Apostles were to bring the money to another part of the world, to aid the other servants of God. The first time the minister read it, I concluded it was to give to others, but it was completely misinterpreted.

The second time we revisited this verse in the lesson, it was to service the needs of all brethren. Awesome! On point. Then the minister proceeded to say that the offerings were used to administer us and for propagation, specifically Gods Message and incmedia (‚Äúpropagation‚Äù)

Outside of the fact the incmedia only seems to make church rap or brown-nosing EVM, that‚Äôs a complete waste of money and the Pasugo, ain‚Äôt nobody reads that! 

Which leads me to believe, that the offerings are meant to administer the church. 

Lol. Not only do the ministers barely make enough to make a living OR plan for retirement, they barely have enough to get by. The brethren pick up the slack. 

Meanwhile, EVM is preaching (arguing with the detractors as form of preaching) in a couple thousand dollar suit, has a private jet to take him everywhere, and has a fat house and first class living situation I‚Äôm sure. 

Is that fair? That sounds, again, like someone that wants to be worshipped, kinda how everyone and they mama prays for EVM and Jesus is an afterthought.

There were other points in the lesson when the apostles seemed to give ‚Äúreasoning for needing money, etc, and it legit came off as someone that was a con artist. Over explaining, taking about people from far away that were struggling.

Either way, this lesson was so frustrating to listen to and this went on way longer than I intended.

* If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat"" ([2 Thess. 3:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Thessalonians+3%3A10&version=NKJV)). Well then, how does that explain a certain Mr. Manalo?
* ""And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you"" ([Eph. 4:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+4%3A32&version=NKJV)). Again, how does that explain he-who-shall-not-be-named (not only with what he did to his own family, but also with what he's doing to the entire church)? Of course my worker wouldn't address this...
   * I take it asking the executive minister (I'm not going to bother capitalizing that.) himself to practice what he preaches is too much...which is why he *always* preaches ""eMbRaCe YoUr MeMbErShIp"" and ""dEpReSsIoN iS a No-No"" instead of ""love thy brother and sister.""
* It's high time the administration and its minions stop being busybodies ([2 Thess. 3:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Thessalonians+3%3A11&version=NKJV)) and stop creeping through the brethren's social media accounts! If they truly believed they were doing God's work, they shouldn't be this paranoid, should they?
* Ah, the good omission and shuffling of verses...I bet the upcoming PPV this weekend \*barfs everywhere\* will have these in spades!
* Like last weekend, I peeked at the worker's cheat-sheet. I only saw the title and didn't want to look any more suspicious than I'm sure I did earlier, so I don't know exactly what translations were used. Like the last few times, I linked to the NKJV since it seems to serve as the ministers'/workers' ""default.""
* Of course my worker and many others' would somehow link the lesson to the church activities, especially the propagational ones.
* Yup...3 lecture hymns in a row followed by a showtune lead up to this.
   * Speaking of the hymns, does anyone's minister/worker stand on the 3rd hymn? I wish mine did; I can't remember the last time he spared us from the 4th hymn.

We were only 2,000 a few years ago. Now 60,000+ .... and JW leadership is feeling the heat. Constant talk about us apostates in literature & in their videos. 

You have many allies from r/exjw r/exmormon r/exmuslim

**Other Comments/Observations**

* Tuloy Tally: 46
   * At least 7 of these occured during the reading of [Micah 7:8, 7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah+7%3A8%2C+7&version=NKJV) (yep, in that order...).
* Total PPV: 1 hour, 38 minutes
* For fear of attracting unwanted attention, I didn't time the prayers this go-around, nor did I catch how long Manalo's sermon lasted. Let's just say all those times are long!
* For you ministers who keep praying for Manalo, why don't you just build a statue in his honor already? Everyone already knows it's what you not-so-secretly want.
* ""Or-DARE-li-ness,"" says the high-pitched Blurryface in the officers' opening prayer.
* As usual, Manalo's reader looks extremely aggravated. Can you blame him? He's probably thinking, ""That's not how we rehearsed it last night!"" or, ""Would you stop interrupting me already?"" or even, ""You literally just said, 'Tuloy!' 3 times within a 4 second span!""
* I wonder if Mr. Matt Pareja misses doing his (in)famous, ""AaAaAhHmMmAaAaAhH!"", complete with hysterical howl-crying in the background, during these Manalo movies.
* So far this year, these Manalo movies have occurred monthly. Now if only they occurred, well, never again.
* Does whoever outlines these ""lessons"" ""accidentally"" shuffle the verses arbitrarily? Worse, do they ""forget"" certain verses even exist?

- God is the solution to all our problems.
- It is not enough that we should be a member of Church of Christ to attain salvation. We need to have a clean/righteous state of living (malinis na pamumuhay)
- Word of the day: Sincere / Sinsero
- We should not be sad if one dies as Iglesia ni Cristo because he already finished his race. What the?
- First part talking about how near we are on judgment day, earthquakes, poverty and diseases. For me, they just update the statistics / cite new news source to prove it
- Prayers for EVM checklist: prayers after singing of hymns - check; prayers after sermon - check; prayers of officers after WS - check.

**Other Comments & Observations**

* The Bible instructs its believers to ""abstain from sexual immorality"" ([1 Thessalonians 4:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+4%3A3&version=NKJV)), yet how many INCers (especially officers and ministers) have violated that?
* [Matthew 15:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+15%3A4&version=NKJV): ""For God commanded, saying, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.' "" Can someone tell me what translation EVM had in mind when he decided to expel not just his mother but also his brother?
* Leave it to my worker to shoehorn the fact that INC is (supposedly) in 160 countries/territories into a lesson about not consuming blood or marrying unbelievers.
* If everyone in INC only courted/married within the INC, would this ""church"" have nearly as many members as it does today, even with its freefalling numbers?
   * Heck, maybe this is more for the safety/sanity of those *outside* the ""church"" than inside. To anyone outside considering joining, *don't do it!*
* Don't you just love how the administration shuffles and omits verses to their liking (such as today's Leviticus 17 verses)?
* I don't understand why they didn't just make this ""lesson"" 2 separate topics.
* Another day, another batch of commonly-played hymns (and I use that term loosely).

* As others have mentioned, the sermon is about baptism. Because, as usual, my preacher never mentioned any translations, all following links lead to NKJV, the ""go-to"" translation from what I've seen in my region, unless otherwise stated.

* [1 John 3:4 (KJV?)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+3%3A4&version=KJV)
   * I remember hearing archaic language during this verse; it didn't quite match the NKJV, but it might be a different translation.

**My Comments/Observations**

* ...I'm sorry, why did they feel the need to shuffle the verses? Unless I missed something (and please correct me if I did), reading 5 before 4 or 11 before 6 makes no difference from reading the verses in sequential order. Do they run random number generators when outlining the lessons?
* [Deuteronomy 12:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+12%3A32&version=NKJV) states, ""...you shall not add to it nor take away from it,"" yet what has the INC been doing since 1913? The exact opposite of what this verse says, you say?
* Welp, I guess we now know what will happen (if it hasn't already) to, well, all the preachers in this so-called church ([Revelation 22:18-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+22%3A18-19&version=NKJV)). Tell me again why the last (and last, and last...) messenger(s) get lauded as much as they do?
* INC pressures baptismal candidates to get baptized ASAP, then proceeds to state that only those who believe should be baptized...
* [Philippians 2:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2%3A8&version=NKJV) must be one of the verses the administration loves (ObEy AnD nEvEr CoMpLaIn...).
* Once again the preacher flaunts the (possibly alternative) fact that ThE cHurCh Is In 160 CoUnTrIeS aNd TeRrItOrIeS.
   * Or maybe it's a real fact and a sizable chunk of that 160 has double- (or even single-) digit serial numbers. ""Quality over quantity"" apparently doesn't exist in the ~~Cult of Manalo~~ INC...

**My Comments/Observations**

* Leave it to my preacher to shoehorn the administration while explaining [Matthew 6:9-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A9-12&version=GNT), claiming we should also pray for them. Just last weekend, did he not read [Deuteronomy 12:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+12%3A32&version=NKJV) and [Revelation 22:18-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+22%3A18-19&version=NKJV)?

**Hymns & Commentary**

* 274: ""Serve And Worship Our God""
   * This hymn is literally the only one in today's lineup where the singer actually sings to God. However, that only occurs in stanza two. The first part seems to be a lecture hymn in first person plural form.
* 315: ""We Give Praise And Thanks""
   * [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfVaJ5eClys)
   * scary-sounding because of its chord progression (much use of minor chords/harmonic minor, many dissonant chords)
   * last half of second stanza is about how we were called ""to His nation,"" where ""the precious hope of salvation lives"" in an attempt to keep the worshipers trapped
   * The title just seems superficial, as the singer never truly sings to God (or Christ). Any instances of God refer to him in the third person.
* 31: ""Reach Out And Offer Now Your Help""
   * propagation hymn meets lecture hymn
   * ""Reach out and offer now your help/To all the souls that will be judged..."" yep, fearmongering lyrics of a fearmongering ""church""
* 151: ""Our Father Is So Generous With His Graces""
   * INC: ""God's love is unconditional^(\[citation needed\]).""
   * Also INC: ""Our Father is so generous...if you will place all your trust in Him.""
   * Also Also INC: ""Our Father lovingly reserves/The great blessings that He will give/To His devoted chosen ones/True in renewing the lives they lead.""
   * Nitpick: Don't you just love excessively long titles?
   * lecture hymn
* 249: ""You Must Always Pray""
   * [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQgKr9FoQcw)
   * lecture hymn

HOUSEHOLD WORSHIP SERVICE BASED ON THE LESSON OUTLINED BY BROTHER ERA√ëO G. MANALOWEDNESDAY/THURSDAY: MARCH 17/18, 2021

EACH MEMBER OF THE CHURCH OF CHRIST SHOULD TAKE PART IN THE WORK OF SPREADING THE GOSPEL AND SHOULD LEARN HOW TO PRAY

Sharing our faith is one of the basic teachings that we, members of the Church Of Christ, firmly believe in and fulfill. Another basic teaching that we should also fulfill is praying to our Lord God and to our Lord Jesus Christ. We should fully benefit from our right to do so and from the blessings that it will bring to us. So, each of us should learn how to pray. Let us study these two important teachings.

It is our duty to share with our fellowmen the truth that it is only in the Church Of Christ where people can render to God the worship that is worthy before Him, and it is only here where salvation can be attained because, according to Matthew 5:14-16, we have been made lights of the world. Light is intended to shed light. One of the ways by which we can shed light on the people of this world is that we should be found doing good works.

Many people in this world are doing the works of darkness, which is why the world is in darkness. According to Phillipians 2:15, in the midst of darkness or of ‚Äúa crooked and perverse generation‚Äù, we are expected to be without fault and blameless children of God. Therefore, we should be different from the people of the world. What must be found in us are the good works so we will shine as lights. By that, we will be able to encourage the people of this world to join the Church. Intensive renewal of life can help us in fulfilling our duty to spread the gospel.

Aside from being light, we are also likened to the salt of the earth, based on Matthew 5:13. We have been made salt of the earth because the people of the world are in the bondage of corruption, according to Romans 8:21. One of the uses of salt is to prevent or to fight decay‚Äîfor example, of food. Thus, we should help in the work of spreading the words of God through our missionary works to set free those who have been enslaved by corruption and to bring them to salvation.

An easy way to share our faith is like what was done by the Samaritan woman to whom our Lord Jesus Christ spoke. Based on John 4:28-30, the Samaritan woman left her water pot‚Äîthat is equivalent to putting aside for a moment her personal concerns‚Äîand went to the city to invite people to listen to Christ.

It is similar to the sacrifices of the many brethren in our time. They are ready to put aside for a moment their personal concerns so they can invite people who will listen to the preaching of the gospel.  It is proven in John 4:39 and 41-42 that the Samaritan woman‚Äôs invitation to the people was effective. Many of them believed in our Lord Jesus Christ. The same result is obtained when many brethren invite people to listen during our evangelical missions. It should not be many brethren only but all should help and take part in the work of sharing our faith.

Let‚Äôs imitate the dedication to helping in the works of propagation that God‚Äôs servant back then did. In Psalm 40:9-10 (Good News Bible), he said: In the assembly of all your people, Lord, I told the good news that you save us. You know that I will never stop telling it. I have not kept the news of salvation to myself; I have always spoken of your faithfulness and help. In the assembly of all your people I have not been silent about your loyalty and constant love.

Even if we have helped in the propagation of the gospel in the past and bore fruit already, still, we should never stop fulfilling it. Let us continue to invite guests to our evangelical missions‚Äîwhether they are being conducted in the house of worship, or on-air and online. Let us distribute God‚Äôs Message magazine and other pamphlets that we use in our propagation. Let us encourage our friends and acquaintances to tune in to our radio and television programs and to visit our websites. If, in your area, a place for Bible study sessions is needed and there is enough space in your home, you can allow it to be used as a place of missionary work and Bible study sessions.

The apostles made sure in Philippians 4:3 (Contemporary English Version) that the names of the brethren who help in the work of propagation are written in the book of life or they will be saved. Thus, helping in the work of spreading the gospel has a great bearing on our salvation. Let us not be lazy about it or be regretful of our sacrifices when we fulfill this obligation. 

For us to victoriously uphold this holy endeavor and for us to remain steadfast whatever we encounter in life, let us fulfill what our Lord Jesus Christ taught in Luke 18:1 that we should always pray so we will not lose heart.
Based on Matthew 26:41, prayer is also what is needed so we can overcome all temptations. Our Lord Jesus Christ had already tested and proven that in His life, which is why that is what He has been teaching us. If we obey this, no matter how many and severe the temptations coming to our lives are, we can also overcome them.

If we would feel worried because of the severity of our problems, let us do what the apostles advise in Philippians 4:6: Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; 

May it be that we are fulfilling this advice. Family devotional prayer should be well-established in our respective homes, and we conduct the Iglesia Ni Cristo Family Hour. In James 5:14-15, it is being taught what other benefit we can gain from praying: Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.

Those referred to as elders of the Church are the ministers, deacons, and deaconesses. Let us firmly believe that through prayer with the anointing of oil, God will heal us from our illness.  However, the first among the many things that we ask from God, based on Luke 17:5, should be for Him to increase our faith. One of the characteristics of one who is growing in the faith is prayerfulness.

Commonly, the appointed time for the personal prayers of God‚Äôs early servants were in the ‚Äúevening and morning and at noon,‚Äù based on Psalm 55:17. We should also set the time for our personal devotional prayers aside from the family devotional prayers that the head of the household leads. Let us also be dedicated to attending our committee prayer or group prayer meetings. The father or the head of the household is the one responsible to attend there.

In First Corinthians 10:31, Apostle Paul stated that, ‚ÄúWhatever you do, do all to the glory of God.‚Äù So, let us pray to God whatever we will do. Parents should teach their children to be prayerful. They should set themselves as good examples by being devoted to praying. Our Lord Jesus Christ taught us how to pray in Matthew 6:9-12 (GNB). 

The first things that we should say in our prayers are praises and thanksgiving to God, then, we ask for forgiveness of the sins we committed. Let us ask God to increase our faith and to give us our daily needs, including our spiritual needs. Hence, let us also not forget to pray for the Church Administration who tirelessly cares for our spiritual well-being. Let us not forget to also pray to our Lord Jesus Christ to ask Him to mediate for us with the Father. Let us remember that Christ is the throne of grace Who also can grant us our needs, based on Hebrews 4:14 and 16.

Our Lord Jesus Christ taught in John 15:16 that we ask everything we are praying for in His Name. For He said, ‚ÄúThat whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you. ‚ÄùWe should posess the characteristics of those who pray that will surely be answered. According to Mark 11:24(New Life Version), he who prays that has faith will be answered and will receive what he asks for. On the other hand, he who doubts will not receive anything from the Lord, according to James 1:6-8.

Another important condition for our prayers to be heard is written in First John 3:22: And whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.

So, let us obey the commands of God. Let us do what pleases Him. Let us also make sure that what we are asking for in our prayers to God are in accordance with His will and will bring us closer to Him. Let us request for the things that we can use in serving Him and in fulfilling our duties.Let us not hesitate to draw near to God because it is made certain in Isaiah 30:18 (GNB):

And yet the Lord is waiting to be merciful to you. He is ready to take pity on you because he always does what is right. Happy are those who put their trust in the Lord.

Let us implore God not to fail us when we are calling to Him and are asking for His help as we go through the difficult trials and problems in life. May He uphold and defend us always. May He help all of us finish our race and remain in the hope for the blessing that will soon be ours.",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/m6qksh/midweek_worship_service_examination_mar_17_mar_19/

"Mid-week Worship Service Examination (Mar 17 - Mar 19, 2021)",m6qksh,2021-03-16,"A commentary on the Wed. worship service 3/18/2021

This is about Propagation and being Prayerful.

Why Propagate?

1. Matthew 5:14-16  

14 ‚ÄúYou are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. 15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. 16 In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.

\*You know what kind of light I am? A lighthouse. yep. The kind that you can see a mile away warning the ships to be careful or get shipwrecked. So I am saving them in a different way by telling them to stay away from this rocky shit that is the INC.\*

What else?

2. Matthew 5:13-16 ‚ÄúYou are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. 

\*So we should be morally upright Christians, free from corruption. And thus gives no reason for our enemy to criticise us (quoting the minister). I suppose this only apply to members yes? EVM and administration can expel his mom and siblings or imprisoned his brother. Don't get me started on those killed because they ""fought"" the administration. Even the Canadian who was killed because he complained after being inconvenienced when a baranggay chapel was constructed right beside him house and brethren using his property for parking without permission.

Yeah forgot all of those and concentrate on propagation. why? ""Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God."" (Romans 8:21). Yes, it is our duty to deliver them from ONE bondage of corruption... to another.\*

Then onward to Praying and Faith.

Minister says we have this privilege so we should take advantage of this. Especially if we are sick. Because as it said in James 5:13-15

 Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray. Is anyone happy? Let them sing songs of praise. 14 Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. 15 And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven.  

 Also, We should pray daily, in the morning, lunch, evening. We should have devotional prayer, personal prayer, group prayer, join in the officer's prayer and the like.

\*In short Praying will make you more Faithful and the mark of being faithful is being prayerful. So like a feed-back loop.

Hold on stop right there... isn't that a contradiction? If you have faith, shouldn't one prayer  enough! You don't need to keep repeating the same request in every prayer like ""Bless/Protect/Give power to the most dynamic leader"". Oh boy, is god deaf? Now of course a prayer of praise and thanks you can do that all day long. SkyDaddy wants to hear endless praises anyway (don't forget that is the reason why he created mankind in the first place) It kind of ego-boost lifting his self-esteem I guess. 

Apostle James actually has a warning for doubters: James 6: But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. 

But they inconveniently forgot to add 2 major verse about Prayer and Faith:

1. Matthew 6:7 And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. 8 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

2. Matthew 8:5-13- an account when a Roman Centurion approach him and requested to heal his servant. Jesus ask if he should come and heal the servant but the Officer said, ""Lord you don't have to go, Simply say he is healed and it will happen"". That's how strong his faith is and even Jesus remarked that he has yet to find someone in israel with a faith as strong as that man has.\*

\*In the end: The minister went back to propagation and implored, pls. brethren even just if we can target 1 soul per household that will help a lot. uhhh.. so not 6 souls per household anymore? you just stood there for more than 30 minutes talking about having faith and now this? Did we not have have a weeklong devotional prayer for that 6 souls?

  Where is your faith now? You doubt we can't get this? I thought God is with us so why now this waffling and settling even for just one? Can you see how all those sermon about faith and all just got thrown out of the window?\*

Then a sermon is not complete without a reminder of what pleases god. And yes! you got it brethren its offering. We need to help our ecofarm in Africa (India not included this time maybe next month) because if we are to believe those INCMedia pictures, lots of Africans are starving. It would not make a good photo-ops when we have the fat minister posing with thin, severely malnourished africans.  We expect your unity in this worthy endeavor (read: we will find out who did not give and we will monitor you).

Rants / Takeaways:

- There is something off on this lesson. Or, maybe I was not really paying attention before. I think one of the focus of this fundamental lesson is about voting right? You can correct me if I am wrong. But why do I feel like it's about obedience in the church administration now? Yeah, I don't know..
- ""Sino ka para kumwestiyon sa pamamahala?"" / Who are you to question church administration? The minister said. What the heck? That statement made my blood boil! üò°
- This is just the context but the minister also said that if there is someone questioning the church administration, then he is on the devil's side, not on God's. Ok, let me burn in hell.
- He said further.. that we should be thankful to the church administration, because he cares for us, especially this pandemic. Oh really? He cares so they will still push through the CWS. Nonstop meetings / offerings despite the pandemic. 6 fruits to bear this year. Ahh okay he cares!
- What is your explanation about having no F13 today and all of the special offering will go to Aide for africa? You care for Africa that much?",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/m8y0w2/weekend_worship_service_examination_mar_20_mar_23/

THE BELIEVERS IN CHRIST ARE IN ONE ORGANIZED CHURCH‚ÄîTHE TRUE CHURCH OF CHRIST

(HOUSEHOLD WORSHIP SERVICE BASED ON THE LESSON OUTLINED BY BROTHER ERA√ëO G. MANALO WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY: MARCH31/APRIL 1, 2021)

Protestants claim that the Church Of Christ comprises all believers in Christ, regardless of whatever religious group they belong to. To them, membership in a church is not important because, allegedly, whether or not one is a member of any particular church, that person belongs to the Church Of Christ and is considered as belonging to Christ as long as he believes in Christ. The said teaching of Protestants is based on a wrong notion because, according to the Bible, the true believers in Christ are in one organized Church.

We are sure of that because, based on the pronouncement of Christ in John 6:44, the only ones who can come to Christ are those who are drawn or brought by the Father to Him. The Father brings people to Christ by calling them to have fellowship with Christ, according to First Corinthians 1:9 (Today‚Äôs English Version). They are placed or gathered in one body or in the Church that is headed by Christ, according to Colossians 1:18 and 3:15. As there is one Christ Who is the Head, there is also one Church, which is His body. Therefore, those who have been called to have fellowship with Christ are gathered in one Church or in only one organization; they are not splintered into many different churches and denominations.

Those who were called by God to have fellowship with Christ, based on Ephesians 2:15, were created by Christ in Himself as one new man. The one new man comprises Christ as the Head and the Church as His body. The members of the one Church are parts that are joined together in the one body. Because the true Church is the body of Christ, it is named the Church Of Christ, based on First Corinthians 12:12 (Weymouth).

To become members of the true Church Of Christ, people are baptized ‚Äúinto one body,‚Äù according to First Corinthians 12:13. Hence, we are certain that the believers in Christ and those who truly belong to Him are in one organized Church only, because they belong to only one body‚Äînot to many different bodies. 

The true Church is called the body of Christ to show its oneness. In the true Church, the parts or members are joined together in one organization, based on Romans 12:4-5 (TEV). Just like in a literal human body, the parts or members of the body of Christ, which is the Church, are joined together‚Äînot separate or detached from one another, according to First Corinthians 12:12.

Meanwhile, according to A Study of Denominations, on pages 1, 3, 4, and6, ‚Äúit is difficult to compute the number of [Protestant] denominations‚Äù because there are too many, especially because divisions continue to take place within Protestantism. Protestants themselves notice that the divisions that exist within them are what the apostles condemned and forbade and that this ‚Äústands diametrically opposed to the intent and prayer of Jesus.

Hence, the concept of a denominational church is foreign to the New Testament, and therefore unscriptural.‚Äù

According to them also, divisions arise within Protestantism resulting in sects, denominations, and contentions because the Protestants show ‚Äúmore respect to religious teachers than to Christ.‚Äù The division within Protestantism shows that it is not the true body of Christ. Protestant churches do not belong to Christ because, according to James 3:14-16 (American Standard Version), division or faction is not a wisdom that come from above or from God; instead, it is ‚Äúearthly, sensual, devilish.‚Äù

Division and faction have no place in the true Church. What reigns over the true Church is unity. No matter how far it has extended its mission and no matter how many its members have become, it shall remain as one body or one Church and its unity shall remain. This is to ensure ‚Äúthat there should be no schism in the body‚Äù or Church, according to First Corinthians 12:20 and25. Apostle Paul taught what binds the unity in the Church in Ephesians 4:4-6:  
There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.

Isn‚Äôt that really what binds our unity as members of the Church Of Christ? Therefore, we are the true believers in Christ‚Äîwe who belong to this one organized Church.

On the other hand, the false ‚Äúbelievers in Christ,‚Äù according to Matthew 7:21 (TEV), are those who merely call Christ as Lord but do not do the will of the Father in heaven. God‚Äôs will, according to Ephesians 1:9-10, is that all people be gathered together in Christ. One can fulfill that by being joined together as among the parts or members of the body of Christ, based on Romans12:4-5 (TEV). The Bible says ‚Äújoined to each other‚Äù and not separate from one another; it is not denominational or splintered into various denominations like the Protestant sects.

Still, other people reason out that it is also the Name of Christ that they use or invoke. They even claim that they are able to perform many miracles in His Name. However, that doesnot offer enough proof of beingtrue‚Äúbelievers in Christ.‚Äù In Matthew 7:22-23, Christ refusedto acknowledge the people mentioned in these verses even though they claim to know Him, call to Him as Lord, profess belief in Him, and perform wonders or miracles in His Name. Instead, Christ even told them: ‚ÄúDepart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!‚Äù Christ rejected them because their faith has been without works; and so, it is without profit, is useless, and cannot save them, according to James 2:14 (New American Standard Bible).

Even if one claims to have faith, such faith is worthless if it is without works and the person who has such kind of faith is foolish, based on James 2:18-20 (NASB). We are certain that faith without works is without profit and cannot save because even demons also believe but they will not be saved.

Because of that, the kind of faith that is necessary for salvation is perfect faith because it is coupled with works, based on James 2:22. The work that one should couple his faith with for it to become perfect and lead him to salvation is that which Christ tells people to do. According to Luke 6:46, Christ does not consider as His disciples those who refuse to do what He says. One of the things that Christ said or taught that must be done by anyone who wants to be saved is written in John 10:9 (Revised English Bible): 
I am the door; anyone who comes into the fold through me will be safe...


The fold or flock being referred to is the Church Of Christ (Acts 20:28 Lamsa translation). Those who joined the Church Of Christ will be saved because it is the Church Of Christ that was redeemed with the blood of Christ and its members are the ones who received the forgiveness of sins and will receive salvation. Therefore, even if people claim to be believers in Christ but they are outside the Church Of Christ, they will not be acknowledged by Christ as His and they will not be saved.

This truth that the Bible teaches is the same truth that was taught by God‚Äôs Messenger in the last days, Brother Felix Manalo, which was also upheld by Brother Era√±o Manalo, and is continuously being upheld by the present Executive Minister, Brother Eduardo Manalo.

"Mid-week Worship Service Examination (Mar 31 - Apr 02, 2021)",mgwnuy,2021-03-30,"I zone out out all the time,  but my ears perked up when I heard the minister cite 1 Corinthians 12:12 (Weymouth) Have they always used Weymouth before? I know INC throws in Romans 16:16 to give the illusion that there are multiple instances of the phrase Church of Christ in the Bible, but I swear this is the first time I‚Äôve heard of a Weymouth translation and what a shocker, another obscure Bible translation that nobody uses üòÇ

I Corinthians 12:12 Weymouth
‚ÄúOr just as the human body is one and yet has many parts, and all its parts, many as they are, constitute but one body, so it is with the Church of Christ.‚Äù

Looks like EGM made the mistake of choosing the wrong obscure Bible translation (that most people have never heard of), as their official fundamental verse to use.  Unlike their precious Acts 20:28 Lamsa, in 1 Corinthians 12:12 Weymouth , the ‚ÄúC‚Äù in church is actually capitalized.  Also, Weymouth was published in 1903 compared to Lamsa (1933).

I swear EVM/administration is scouring through all obscure Bible translations ever written in search of the phrase church of Christ, so they can cover up the Acts 20:28 Lamsa Fallacy. If any of you OWE‚Äôs are lurking and read this, a suggestion to add Hebrews 12:22-23 Remedy New  Testament.

   * The latter half of this verse was taught maybe once back in 2018. Will it ever see the light of day again?
* Unless otherwise dictated, the translations and links provided above correspond to u/anggelwinsantos' comment.

**Comments/Observations**

* INC points out that the Protestants supposedly ""show more respect to religious teachers than to Christ."" Then what is the purpose of all the EVM portraits? Has INC ever heard of this thing called ""a mirror""? This will especially prove laughable in the upcoming PPV when the minister(s) wail(s), ""PlEaSe BlEsS tHe MoSt ImPoRtAnT mAn On EaRtH!"" for what seems like an eternity.
   * Heck, later in the sermon, the preacher instructs us to be one with EVM/the administration. I seriously want to strap him to a lie detector and ask him if he believes even a tiny fraction of what he says.
* INC will claim the doctrine has remained unchanged since the time of the messenger. Can even one of its ministers/workers prove such a claim by mentioning all the points the DeTrAcToRs raise and proving them wrong? Or will every last preacher simply say, ""DoN't Go On ThOsE wEbSiTeS,"" ""DoN't LiStEn To ThE oUtSiDeRs,"" etc.?
* Preacher shoehorns the fact that the INC ~~has invaded~~ can be found in 160 countries and territories. And how many of that 160 AREN'T dwindling in serial number?
* Also, the preacher shoehorns bible studies, activities, etc., claiming we should attend ALL of them...
* INC will go out of its way to claim there's no schism/division within. Hmm...what was that thing that happened nearly 6 years ago?
* Is anyone else's local pushing for as many brethren as possible (barring front-liners, those above a certain age, those with underlying medical conditions, etc.) to attend in the place of worship? What do they think will happen when (not if) the number of cases starts increasing exponentially once more?
* Is it just me, or is the administration trying to shoehorn/cherry-pick more Bible verses (and other textual ""evidence,"" even if non-Biblical) into its lessons (judging by how long my ""Sermon"" section seems to be getting)?

**Hymns**

* 25 (""We Worship You Today"")
* 314 (""You Are Indeed the One True God"")
   * God is (supposedly) only with the cult and no one else
* 94 (""The Kingdom, So Glorious and Blessed"")
   * Hymn tries to make you feel happy you were ~~forced~~ called into this ""church""
* 238 (""Safeguard Our Election"")
   * Title says it all, but just in case:
   * Lecture hymn about submission, duty, and...wait for it...never leaving the church!
* 186 (""We Wait for Him"")
   * Surprisingly, ""Him"" doesn't refer to Manalo...unless/until the music dept. tries to distort an already distorted hymn...
* 72 (""Your Life Will Be Peaceful"")
   * Lecture hymn
* The would-be offertory this month is 107 (""Each of Us Should Always Give an Offering"")
   * Lecture hymn with self-explanatory title
      * Let's be real, though...""*an* offering""? Each week has *at least* 4 different types of offering!
   * 1st stanza and refrain include lyrics about propagation
* 287 (""Do You, in Truth, Belong to Jesus?"")
   * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBlrTIaA5D8&list=PLvjgSOUle2Ng164q0H7w4AVC1LhmyIFf6&index=38)

   * Last verse contains a mention of the worship service and always returning to it

**Just for Fun/My Comments & Observations**

* Tuloy Tally: 5...dozen (Stick around for a stroll down Memory Lane!)
   * I just love how some of them sound like he's singing (or trying to)
* Again, since I didn't want to attract unwanted attention, I didn't time the prayers or sermon (or even how long the entire fiasco was).
* Manalo quips that to list every locale celebrating its anniversary would take the entire time, but has no problem giving an equivalently time-wasting sermon that, barring a few nuances, has been done to death and beyond.
* Manalo thanks God that we are members of INC. Well...who else will contribute to his semiweekly paycheck (which I suspect is why he mentioned offerings)?
* Subtlety, thy name is not Manalo. How does he expect to convert anyone or keep current brethren this way? Oh right, he just wants clout and money.
* Manalo himself admits the pandemic continues to worsen...but what exactly is he doing about it? Telling brethren to uphold their elections simply doesn't help, regardless of what he tells himself or what his yes-men tell him.

**Hymns and Comments**

* Foreword: I decided to include many of the older lyrics to demonstrate the church's brainwashing tactics, even during my probationary period in 2009-10.
* 237: ""Accept Me Once More""
   * Not much to say here, good or bad, with this hymn or its prior revisions.
* 306: ""Our Lord God Does Not Forsake His Nation""
   * If I remember correctly, this hymn was strategically released some time after the 2015 scandal occurred, and it definitely shows:
      * the title itself, as reflected in the refrain and first stanza
      * The second stanza is dedicated to the so-called detractors: *""All those who opposed and fought against/God's Messenger and holy work/They were vanquished, they were put to shame/God's prophecy fulfilled!""*
   * May 306 be uploaded to YouTube one day, as all I can describe it as is a showtune masked as a ""hymn.""
* 227: ""I Am So Truly Blessed""
   * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZzwqiHuSI0&list=PLvjgSOUle2Ng164q0H7w4AVC1LhmyIFf6&index=37)
   * ""Never leave the church"" hymn
   * Refrain includes a lyric about duty.
   * Even before this hymn got a new composition around 2014, the old lyrics were about as cult-ish (for lack of a better term) as they are now.
      * For example, the first stanza: *""How fortunate am I indeed/How truly blessed is my life/Because I know that I belong/Here in the Church of Christ.""*
* 5: ""To Our Savior, Confide All""
   * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vV3obrvR1o&list=PLvjgSOUle2Ng164q0H7w4AVC1LhmyIFf6&index=32)
   * The only old lyrics I know are: *""He gives light in darkness/ . . . /All your fears, all your tears, take to Jesus/And rest in His faithfulness.""* and *""Soar to light in darkness/ . . . /All your prayers, all your cares, take to Jesus/And rest in his faithfulness.""*
   * Like 227, this hymn was temporarily retired before returning with an entirely new composition around 2013-14.
* 92: ""There Is a Promised Land""
   * Refrain includes lyric about remaining in one's duty (even before the 2013 rewrite).
   * Last part of second stanza has fearmongering lyrics: *""Yet all those left behind/Will weep in vain to find/That heaven's doors have closed/Forevermore.""*
      * Some time before the 2013 rewrite (possibly around 2008-09ish?): *"". . .The gates indeed have closed/To this, our home.""*
      * Closer to the 2013 rewrite (c. 2010-11): *""Yet sorrow waits for those/Who find the doors have closed/Forever left behind/Denied all hope.""*
* 55: ""The Truth, Only in the CHURCH OF CHRIST""
   * Lecture hymn
   * The first ""sentence"" in the first stanza is really a fragment: *""The glorious and divine truth‚Äîonly in the CHURCH OF CHRIST.""*
      * Pre-2013 lyrics: *""The Church of the Lord's salvation truly is the treasure of Christ.""*
   * Refrain: stay in the church and never doubt: *""Never turn away dear brethren/From the Church loved by the LORD. Let's remove all doubts from our minds/And be faithful evermore.""*
      * Pre-2013 lyrics: *""In the Church of Christ continue/Every trace of doubt subdue/Ever nurturing within you/Faith most deep, devout, and true.""*
* 287: ""Do You, in Truth, Belong to Jesus?""
   * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBlrTIaA5D8&list=PLvjgSOUle2Ng164q0H7w4AVC1LhmyIFf6&index=38)
   * Lecture hymn masked as a feel-good hymn
   * Last verse contains a mention of the worship service and always returning to it.
   * I wish I knew the old lyrics. All I know are: *""Are you the blessed ones of Jesus?""* and *""Rise and rejoice. . . .""*

ADDENDA: 

* Hymns 237 and 5 are the only things stopping the lineup from being complete dreck. Who knows when we'll see 5 again, since it's a very seldom played hymn.
* This lesson must be where the music dept. got the ""inspiration"" to write ""hymns"" such as 43 (""Do Not Be Sad and Do Not Fear"") and 466 (""Rejoice in Your Suffering"").
   * 43, 2nd stanza: *""If persecution comes to you/Be filled with joy and not with grief. . . .""*
   * Old 43, 1st stanza: *""When there are troubles in your life/When burdens deep in life befall/Let there be joy within your heart/For He will guide you through it all.""*
* Once again, the preacher pressures as many people as possible to return to the place of worship, claiming, ""God will keep us safe in His house.""
* Also, the preacher plugs Bible studies and other activities to guilt trip the brethren into attending.

Terrible joke I heard from the minister is why has Jesus Christ risen first before the members? It goes like this. Notice when you wake up, your head would rise first? Since JC is the head of this church, he has risen first! (lololol wth) 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
The WS was painstakingly long because the minister had to LITERALLY narrate what happens during the rapture. I mean why do we care about the sequence of who would be resurrected first? Then ending the looong sermon with the same old predictable statement, ""That's why we neeeeed to embrace our membership with this church.""

1 out of 5.

Seven Deadly Themes Covered: Offerings, Administration, Propagation.

My notes:
- My own translation of the title: Faithful is the one who puts hope in the grace that will come
- I thought that this lesson will be slightly different but f*ck.. hell no!!
- Based on the lesson: here is INC's checklist that you are faithful / show faith
1. Recognize and respect our most important man in the world, EVM. Oh yeah!! You're number one on the checklist!! 
2. Dedication to attend worship services
3. Offerings!! (Macedonians mentioned again!)
4. Being firm on the things we believe. Because the devil will do anything to make us doubt! (Just like this sub? Lol). So... we need to intensify our propagation! Not again! 
5. He does what is right.

Don't let the devil decieve you! (With facts and evidence) It will only lead you to (freedom, happiness and a future) death and hell (better then living with OWEs)

"Weekend Worship Service Examination (Apr 24 - Apr 27, 2021)",mxbc1l,2021-04-23," MACEDONIA BIBLE VERSE! SEE HOW THEY CHERRY PICKED THE VERSE.

**In the recent WS they read the verse 2 Corinthians 8:1-3 and used the Bible version** ***EASY ENGLISH Bible.***

But if we read the verse on **NIV** ***(New International Version)***, this is what we get:

*1. And now, brothers and sisters, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonian churches.*

*2. In the midst of a very severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity.*

*3. For I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own,*

**THEY CHERRY PICKED** ***EASY ENGLISH BIBLE*** BECAUSE IT SAYS THERE:

1¬†My Christian friends, let me tell you about the *believers* in the *churches* in Macedonia. God has been very kind to them. 2¬†They have had bad troubles, but they continued to be very happy. As a result, ***they gave a lot of money*** to other people. They themselves are very poor, but they still helped other people a lot. 3¬†Let me tell you this. ***They gave as much money*** as they were able to give. Then they gave even more than that! They gave it because they wanted to.

**SEE THE EMPHASIS ON MONEY????**

**The original version of this text (Textus Receptus is this...)**

As you can see, if you look at it, word for word, **there is no MONEY in the text** but rather it says: ***they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability.***

***QUESTION IS WHAT THEY GAVE AND TO WHOM THEY GAVE?***

**WHAT THEY GAVE?**

ANS: NOT OFFERING. IT IS TO HELP OTHERS (LET US SEE THE VERSE THE MINISTER READS USING *EASY ENGLISH BIBLE)*

1¬†My Christian friends, let me tell you about the *believers* in the *churches* in Macedonia. God has been very kind to them. 2¬†They have had bad troubles, but they continued to be very happy. As a result, ***they gave a lot of money*** ***to OTHER PEOPLE.*** They themselves are very poor, but they still **helped OTHER PEOPLE** a lot. 3¬†Let me tell you this.

Seven Deadly Themes Covered: Don't Leave the INC, (little) Offerings, The Administration, (little) Intensive Propagation

Notes:
- My own translation: Obedience to God is important to overcome problems in life
- Poverty, problems, calamities, crimes - these are signs that the end of the world is near
- God already forewarned us that we will go through all of these
- To overcome these, we need to listen and obey God. So we should not neglect worship services
- We don't have any reason to be weak and discouraged because the blessings of God will make us strong and inspire us to fulfill our duties being a Christian
- We will receive abundance from God if we will prioritize His works and obey His teachings - guess what were enumerated? offerings, intensive propagation, obedience to administration, love of (INCs) brotherhood.. nice entry
- The last sentence again reiterates the importance of praying to God and... AND OBEDIENCE TO THE ADMINISTRATION because of their unwearied efforts to guide and teach us the words of God for our salvation.

* Deadly Theme: The Administration (mentioned extensively through the introduction; interspersed throughout the remainder of the sermon)
   * I kid you not, my preacher managed to mention *every* Deadly Theme at some point or another, even if only for a few words.
      * He mentions offerings, specifically calling out anyone that dare even think about reducing their contribution.
      * He mentions social media against the church, attempting to refute those who discourage the return to the place of worship.
      * By extension, he labels anyone who writes anything against the church a detractor.
      * He takes a moment to bash other religions, especially the Catholic Church (see one of my comments below).
      * He gravely discourages anyone from leaving the INC.
      * He shamelessly plugs upcoming Bible studies and other activities, and pressures those in attendance into sharing the links and invites. Yep...7 for 7!

(CWS Script was transcribed and translated from tagalog by yours truly)

Title: The Iglesia ni Cristo firmly believes that Felix Manalo is God's Messenger

1. Why does the INC believe in a messenger and God sending a messenger?
-According to Christ, a messenger and sending a messenger is God's will that we should believe in. (John 6:29)

2. Why did Jesus say that sending a messenger is God's act?
-Being a messenger is a calling from God, God decides and gives the right to his messenger. (Hebrews 5:4)

3. What does the Apostles say about preachers who weren't given the right nor called by God?
-They are not tested nor have passed, and have no idea what they are preaching. (II Corinthians 10:12 & 18)

4. How does God call a messenger to start an organization that belongs to God?
-One of the ways that God calls a messenger is through direct contact, just like Moses. (Exodus 3:10-11)

5. In the Christian era, how does God call a messenger?
-Through a prophecy just like John the Baptist and Jesus Christ. (Mark 1:2-4; Luke 4:14 & 16-21)

6. Is there a prophecy that depicts the calling of Bro. Felix Manalo?
-The prophecy of Isaiah about a man that God chose from the ""ends of the earth"". (Isaiah 41:9)

7. When is the time that they call ""ends of the earth""?
-When the end of the earth comes near or the second coming of Christ; wars, famine and earthquakes are the things that Christ warned us. (Matthew 24:3, 33 & 6-8)

8. When did these warning signs got fulfilled that God himself prophesized wherein his Messenger will start his mission to save the people?
-During the First World War in 1914 (footnote of Matthew 24:3 & 6-8 Last Days Bible)

9.  Why wont the past messengers of God be mistaken for the one prophesized in Isaiah 41:9?
-It stated the location to where the messenger will rise, in the far east. (Isaiah 46:11; 43:5 Moffatt)

10. Where was the far east that was prophesized got fulfilled?
-In the Philippines (World History, p. 445)

11. What further proves that Felix Manalo was the prophesized messenger in the far east and the ends of the earth?
-God's promise that he will help and strengthen him in his mission was fulfilled in him. (Isaiah 41:9-10)

12. What does God say towards the people that will go against His Messenger?
-They will be put to shame, confused and will perish. (Isaiah 41:11-12)

13. Why wont the enemies of our faith succeed in stopping the works that the Messenger in these last days have started?
-This is God's work that's why no one can stop it. (Isaiah 43:13)

* 341: ""From the Time That We Have Been Sealed""

* 284: ""I Will Serve You""
   * duty/submission hymn
* [100: ""All My Days, I Will Serve You""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFCadk9eI0A)

* 473: ""His Teachings Should Be Made Completely Manifest in Us""
   * feel-good hymn about duty/obedience
   * The later stanzas of the hymn negatively portray the outside world, as is typical in cults (even non-INC cults)

**My Comments and Observations**

* The two Acts verses are where your minister/worker will guilt trip you by claiming, ""Back then, they worshiped every day; now, we only have to worship twice a week.""
   * Surprisingly, neither of today's Acts verses were 20:28, unless your minister or worker felt like shoehorning it in anyway.
* I'm sure the preacher only mentioned [*The Message*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2%3A12%2C14%2C16&version=MSG) translation for the ""redouble your efforts"" phrase/former campaign.
* Even back in 2014, something about hymn 341 (and the other messenger hymns) didn't seem quite right with me. ""Would God even accept this type of 'hymn'?"" I thought to myself seven years ago, a thought that only screeches even louder as the days progress.
   * For those wondering, the other messenger hymns include (but probably aren't limited to): 89; 152; 201; 234; 244; 268; 278
   * Hymns that mention but don't center around the messenger include: 29; 30; 35; 60; 77; 91; 318; 398; 464 (again, might not be an all-inclusive list. Surprisingly, 29; 77; and 91 aren't in this month's lineup.)
* Funnily, both 100 and 284 used to follow the same title of ""I Will Serve You"", as seen in the YouTube video title, before the church published the hard-bound hymnals in 2017.

THE PRAYER OF JESUS TO THE FATHER CONCERNING THE CHOSEN ONES 

We thank God because, by His mercy, we are members of the Church Of Christ. Many of us came from different religious organizations or faith groups, and, when we were still members of those groups, the Bible categorized us as people of the world. However, when we came to understand the  teaching  of  the  Bible  that  a  person  needs  to  be included among those elected or chosen by our Lord Jesus Christ to be a member of His Church for that person‚Äôs service to be accepted by God and for him to be saved on Judgment Day, we decided to join the Church Of Christ. And despite the persecutions and hindrances that we have experienced, we strive to  keep  safe  and  uphold  our sacred election.

Our Lord Jesus Christ is the first One Who wants us to remain as His chosen so we will be worthy to join Him in the kingdom of heaven on Judgment Day. As proof, Christ prayed to the Father to keep His chosen ones from evil, according to John 17:14-15*:  I have given them Your  word; and  the  world  has  hated  them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. I do not pray that You should  take  them  out  of  the  world,  but that  You should keep them from the evil one.

We are not of this world‚Äîthat is the quality of the chosen ones. Hence, the instruction to us is this: ‚ÄúDo not love the world or the things in the world‚Äù (I John 2:15). Those things that we should not love arethe evils in the world. For that reason, Christ prayed to the Father that He keep us from the evil one. If a chosen one of Christ loves the evils in the world, the Bible says, ‚ÄúThe love of the Father is not in him.‚Äù
For us to remain the chosen ones of Christ and not lose the love of God, let  us  not  love  the  evils in  the  world.  Those evils are ‚Äúthe lust of the flesh, the  lust  of the  eyes,  and  the  pride  of  life,‚Äù which are  not  of  the Father but are of the world(I John 2:16). If a chosen one of Christ loves any of these evils in the world, the love of God will not be in him. In James 4:4,the  Bible  says, ‚ÄúFriendship  with  the  world  is  enmity  with  God.‚Äù Therefore, to love the evils of the world is to make an enemy of God.

Since we are members of the Church Of Christ, we are included among those redeemed by the blood of Christ and forgiven of our sins. As a result,  we  were  removed  from  being  enemies  of  God.  Now,  He recognizes  us  as  His  children  and  reserves  for  us  salvation on Judgment Day.

However, if a member of the Church Of Christ continues to love the world  or  does  not  renew  his  life,  he  regresses  to  being  an  enemy  of God  and one  who is  in  danger  of  condemnation on  Judgment  Day. Hence, we are exhorted by the apostles not to love the world and not to conform to the world so we will be saved.

There are those who fall into violating the teachings of God because they conform to the evil deeds committed by the people of this world. If only we follow the exhortation of the apostles in that we should ‚Äúnot be conformed to this world‚Äù(Romans 12:2),then certainly we will be able to avoid committing evil deeds.

We  are  also exhorted to ‚Äúbe  transformed  by  the  renewing  of  your mind.‚Äù The kind of mind thatwe should have is like that of Christ, the Head of the Church. He is humble and obedient to God. Thus, the Executive  Minister,  Brother  Eduardo  Manalo,  always  teaches  and reminds us to be obedient to all of God‚Äôs commandments, one of which is to uphold the complete and intensive renewal of life.
Obedience to the commandments of God will enable us to prove what is  that  good  and  acceptable,  and  perfect  will  of  God.  We  will  surely experience the good brought about by being obedient.There are people who cannot see the good in obeying the commands of God because they are blinded by the god of this age(II Corinthians 4:4). What the ‚Äúgod of this age‚Äù wants is to bring people to destruction or perdition. Thus, he blinds the minds of those who do not have faith so the light of the gospel does not shine on them. Hence, it is terrible for us not to firmly believe in the teachings of God.

We used to be in that condition when we were still of this world or when we were not yet members of the Church Of Christ. But, now that we are members  of  the  Church  Of  Christ,  we  areno  longer people  of  this world‚Äîour  eyes have  been opened  to  the  truth  and  we have  been enlightened completely. Thus, it is only right that we follow the advice of the apostles: ‚ÄúDo not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.‚Äù We must not allow that we be blinded again by the god of this age so we will not end up in destruction.

Examples  of  those  who  were  blinded were Adam and Eve.  What happened to them is recorded in Genesis 3:1-7. In the garden of Eden, the Lord God gave a commandment to Adam and Eve to care for them and to safeguard their life. God made it clear that they could eat of every tree of the garden, except for the fruit of the tree that was in the midst  of  the  garden.  He also told  them  that  if  they  would  eat  the forbidden fruit, they would die. 

However, instead of giving importance to what God had said and obeying it, they disobeyed it and listened to the  serpent  instead.  The  serpent  said  to Eve that  if  she  and  Adam would eat the forbidden fruit, they would not surely die but would be like God, knowing good and evil. 

The serpent deceived Eve. In Genesis 3:6, the Bible says, ‚ÄúSo when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and  a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.‚Äù 

Because Eve had already been blinded by the god of this age, what was evil became good to her eyes. And so it was for Adam. They both did not  give  importance  to  the  care  and  concern  that  God  had  accorded them. They disobeyed His command. As a result, they were driven out from the garden of Eden. They suffered hardship. Their life was cursed. From then on, they and the rest of humankind were decreed to die.

Let  us  not  imitate  what they  did  so  we  will  not  be condemned.  We must know to whom we must listen so we will be directed to what is truly for our good and not be led astray. We must listen to the true God and not to ‚Äúthe god of this age.‚Äù

According to John 12:31, 16:11, and 8:44, the ‚Äúgod of this age,‚Äù who is also called ‚Äúthe ruler of this world,‚Äù is the devil. He will be cast into the lake  of  fire  on  Judgment  Day  along  with  all  of  those  whom  he deceived, according to Revelation 20:10. He is judged or condemned already because of his wickedness. Satan is a liar and the father of liars.  According  to  Christ,  there  is  no  truth  in  the  devil  and  he  is  a murderer from the beginning. Thus, we must not allow ourselves to be  deceived  by  him  so  we  will  not  be condemned  and  destroyed  on Judgment Day. Let us give utmost importance to our membership in the Church Of Christ. 
Let us uphold our activeness in serving God and in leading a righteous way of life despite the evils that are rampant in this world. Let  us  always  obey  the  will  of  God  that  the  Church  Administration teaches. Let us keep safe our being the chosen ones of our Lord Jesus Christ and bravely fight for it against anyone or anything that aims to ruin it. Let us ask God for help so we will be able to triumph over the evils here in this world, which will ensure our receiving of salvation and eternal life when our Lord Jesus Christ returns.

* ""Why the Church of Christ Is Not Like Any Other Organization or Movement in the World Today""
* Deadly Theme: Other Religions Are Wrong
   * Others Mentioned, but Not Central to the Lesson: The Administration, Intensive Propagation

**Hymns (Warning: Tangents Incoming)**

* 200: ""I Offer My Thanksgiving to You""
* 325: ""Constantly, Give Him Our Joyful Praise""
   * This showtune sounds like 3 different showtunes spliced together. (You might remember this from last year's year-end thanksgiving, or you might not if, like me, you'd rather forget it ever existed.)
* 401: ""The Last Work of Salvation""
   * verses mention the messenger
   * Refrains revolve around keeping the faith, remaining in the church, yadda yadda
   * Scouring through my old comments, I see this ""hymn"" was last sung in [early October](https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/j3obta/weekend_worship_service_examination_oct_02_oct_05/g7peatl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) last year (surprisingly not during a PPV), unsurprisingly in honor of EVM's birth month.
* 503: ""Because You Have Decided to Love Me""
   * This attempt at an emotional hymn only comes across as an attempt to keep the brainwashed brethren brainwashed and make them feel ashamed of themselves. (Of course, by this point, most ""hymns"" in the hymnal are like this.)
* 429: ""I Will Follow Your Commandment, Counsel, and Instruction""
   * how subtle...not...
   * It's almost like Lord Manalo himself wrote this hymn (and 401)...
   * If I remember correctly, this was released in Dec. 2016, and it shows.
   * Even though I'm sure I'm breaking some copyright rule, allow me to type out the entirety of verse 2 (not that the rest of the ""hymn"" is any better...):
   * *I have many needs in my life*  
*I, in faith, want to request,*  
*But, above all, Lord, I beg You*  
*Make me most obedient.*  
*For what benefit would I have*  
*If the whole world I should gain,*  
*But the gift of my salvation*  
*I'd relinquished in exchange?*
   * Need I say more?
* 398: ""Hold onto the Words of ~~Lord Manalo~~ God""
   * Once again searching through old WS notes, I see this was last sung not too long ago‚Äîmore specifically, during the [February PPV](https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/ldpeas/weekend_worship_service_examination_feb_06_feb_09/gm90zh1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) earlier this year.
   * This ""hymn"" includes the lyric ""always obey.""
   * Not only that, but it also name-drops both the Messenger and Administration (yes, both capitalized)! Obedience meets idolatry...if EVM himself didn't write this hymn, I don't know who did...
* [I Am a Member of the Church of Christ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jtvxZ_fay8)
   * To paraphrase slightly what I said [last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/mxbc1l/weekend_worship_service_examination_apr_24_apr_27/gvpwock?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), this is THE submission hymn to end all submission hymns, as it has the singer rejoice in his or her calling at the last weekend of every month (unless there's a concurring PPV, as has happened quite a few times the previous year).
* 473: ""His Teachings Should Be Made Completely Manifest in Us""
   * duty/obedience hymn
   * Tired of this ""hymn""? I have good news and bad news:
      * Good news: All the WSes this month are finally over, so maybe this will be the last time it will ever be sung.
      * Bad news: All this does is make potential room for worse recessional hymns, such as the infamous 349(?) (""There Is No Middle Ground‚ÄîWe Must Choose!"") that mentions the church administration; or 481 (""We Must Never Part""), which‚Äîsurprise!‚Äîtells the worshiper never to leave the church.

Now that the month of May has basically elapsed, hopefully we will get a break from idolatry hymns. I do have the June lineups; stay tuned for those. Unless I'm missing something, the month of June doesn't seem to have any messenger hymns (at least for the AWS lineup), and aside from some higher-numbered hymns here and there, most of the numbers seem to be the regulars (Don't worry too much, however, as 50 and 154 aren't there. :D). My knowledge of the CWS hymns is very limited, so I can't promise the same thing.

To anyone that made it this far, I apologize for the delay. I just had a mixture of a change in my regular schedule and poor time management on my part. Apart from still being in the church because of my parents, all is well here :)

For those who celebrate, Happy Memorial Day! Let us take a moment to remember those who died for our freedoms. \*salute\*",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/nne1fx/weekend_worship_service_examination_may_29_jun_01/

"Mid-week Worship Service Examination (Jun 02 - Jun 04, 2021)",nqbqk5,2021-06-01,"OUR CITIZENSHIP AS MEMBERS OF THE TRUE CHURCH OF CHRIST IS FAR GREATER THAN ANY CITIZENSHIP HERE ON EARTH

Life in this world is full of problems and many people suffer great poverty and misfortunes. The current pandemic that has been plaguing the world is truly serious and terrifying. Strong earthquakes, typhoons, floods, wildfires, and other natural disasters are also constantly ravaging various parts of the world.

We firmly believe that all those things are signs that Judgment Day is very near. That‚Äôs why the Church Administration unceasingly reminds us to always be ready and alert for the return of our Lord Jesus Christ. On that day, He will save us from punishment, grant us eternal life, and bring us with Him to the Holy City.

We are sure that those blessings are reserved forus because we are among those who will be saved. InJohn 10:9 (REB),the Lord Jesus Christ said that ‚Äúanyone who comes into the fold ... will be safe.‚Äù Anyone‚Äîregardless of his or her race, citizenship, or nationality‚Äú will be safe‚Äù as long as he or she obeys Christ‚Äôs command to enter or come into ‚Äúthe fold.‚Äù  That fold or flock is the Church Of Christ (Acts 20:28 Lamsa).

Membership in Church Of Christ is not only for people of a particular race, nationality, or citizenship. In fact, the first to be called to become members o fthe Church were not only the Jews but also the Gentiles (Romans 9:24 NKJV).  The first members of the first-century Church Of Christ were Jews. But during the administration of the apostles, the preaching of the gospel reached non-Jewish nations, and many Gentiles or non-Jews became Church Of Christ members.

Such expansion was also experienced bythe Church Of Christin these last days, of which we are members. The Church today has local congregations in 158 countries and territories around the world, its members representing more than 147 races and ethnicities. 

Even if we come from different races, we are all one in Christ. (Galatians 3:26-28 NCV). That is the quality of the true Church Of Christ. It doesn't matter what race or nationality each of us belongs to. There is no difference among Africans, Americans, Asians, Europeans, and so on, because we are all one in Christ.

Thus, we should not get involved in disputes and quarrels concerning differences in race, gender, or nationality to preserve the unity of the Church. Regardless of what country or nation the local congregations or group worship services are geographically located, we should maintain unity of faith and spirit. Let there be no division among us. Let us treat one another as equals because our Lord Jesus Christ said in Matthew 23:8: ""You are all brethren."" That‚Äôs why we greet one another as brothers and sisters.

We are all brothers and sisters because we are ‚Äúmembers of God‚Äôs household‚Äù and ‚Äúfellow citizens with God‚Äôs people‚Äù (Ephesians 2:19NIVand 12-13 GNB). We, members of the Church Of Christ, are sure of that because although we ‚Äúused to be far away‚Äù from God, we have been ‚Äúbrought near by the blood of Christ"" through our‚Äú union with Christ Jesus.‚Äù  The Church Of Christ is the one redeemed by Christ‚Äôs blood and is in union with Him because it is His body and He is its head.

Hence, regardless of our race or cultural background, as members of the Church Of Christ, ‚Äúour citizenship is in heaven‚Äù (Philippians 3:20 AMP2015). Brethren might move to another country where they hope to have a secure future for themselves and their family, eventually becoming citizens there. However, we should never lose or even jeopardize our citizenship in heaven, which we came to have because of our membership in the Church Of Christ. Citizenship in heaven far exceeds whatever citizenship or status in any country here in this world could ever offer.

A different kind of life awaits us in our true home where our true citizenship is. Here on earth, no country is spared from poverty, inequality, violence, sickness, chaos, and other social ills. But in our true home, in the new heavens and new earth that God is creating, all of those things will be forgotten(Isaiah 65: 17-19 MSG).

So, it is incumbent upon us to hold on firmly to our sacred calling no matter what we experience in this life. Our citizenship as Church Of Christ members is greater than any citizenship here on earth because it will bring us great blessings that we can never find here on earth‚Äîsalvation on Judgment Day and eternal life.

The Church Administration reminds us of the qualities that we must not only possess but also nurture while we are still sojourning in this world. According to Colossians 3:12-14 (AMP): 

Clothe yourselves therefore, as God's own chosen ones (His own picked representatives), [who are] purified and holy and well-beloved [by God Himself, by putting on behavior marked by] tenderhearted pity and mercy, kind feeling, a lowly opinion of yourselves, gentle ways, [and] patience [which is tireless and long-suffering, and has the power to endure whatever comes, with good temper]. Be gentle and for bearing with one another and, if one has a difference (a grievance or complaint) against another, readily pardoning each other; even as the Lord has [freely] forgiven you, so must you also [forgive]. And above all these [put on] love and enfold yourselves with the bond of perfectness [which binds everything together completely in ideal harmony]. 

We should not consider ourselves better than anyone else because of our cultural heritage, race, or nationality. Rather, the Bible teaches us to put on a behavior marked by‚Äú a lowly opinion of yourselves‚Äù and ‚Äúgentle ways,‚Äù especially in dealing with our brothers and sisters in the Church. Let us have tender hearted pity and mercy toward our fellow men who are not yet members of the Church. Thus, in spite of what is currently happening in the world, the Church Administration encourages us to continue inviting people from whatever race and nationality to attend our evangelical missions‚Äîwhether online or in-person‚Äîand to watch our religious programs on incmedia.org and iglesianicristo.net, and on our official social media accounts so they can listen to the true gospel.  The ‚ÄúAid To Humanity‚Äù and ‚ÄúINC-Giving‚Äù projects launched by the Church Administration are effective means to help many individuals and communities fight hunger and poverty. Let us strive to be actively involved in these endeavors.

If ever grievances or misunderstandings arise among Church members, the Bible teaches us to readily pardon or forgive one another. Above all else, let us ‚Äúput on love and enfold ourselves with the bond of perfectness.‚Äù  In that way, the ‚Äúideal harmony‚Äù or perfect Christian unity will be preserved. Mutual respect, compassion, and love will reign in our midst. Indeed, such values are firmly established in the true Church Of Christ.

The many problems that plague society will even intensify and continue until Judgment Day. Hence, in our prayers to God, let us ask Him to listen closely and hear our cry, to help and comfort us whenever troubles come, and to look down on us with pity and grant us the strength we need (Psalm 86: 6-7 and 16-17 TLB).

Whatever hardships we experience in life, we should always remember that our citizenship is in heaven‚Äîin the Holy City, our true home. There, righteousness and true peace reign. There, a glorious life awaits us. May that be our inspiration and hope as we journey through this world until we complete our race.

**Personal Commentary**

* Shoutout to u/anggelwinsantos for posting the HWS text and available verse translations!
* [John 10:9 (REB)](https://www.studylight.org/bible/eng/reb/john/10-9.html), predictably, was not read in its entirety. The last part of the verse was taught maybe once, back in 2018.
* [Matthew 23:8 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+23%3A8&version=NKJV): ""But you, do not be called ‚ÄòRabbi‚Äô; for One is your Teacher, the Christ, and you are all brethren."" If this is true, why don't ministers object to being called, ""po,"" etc.? Moreover, does EVM object to being called, ""po,"" ""sir,"" etc.? If he doesn't, I wouldn't be surprised.
* The last time my preacher attempted to demonstrate how widespread the church is, he mentioned 160 countries/territories. Was he rounding? The HWS text puts the figure in question at only 158. If both figures are true, what happened to the remaining 2 countries and territories \*thinking emoji\*?
   * Moreover, apparently 147 ethnicities compose the church's census. The obvious one aside, what is the approximate breakdown of the remaining 146 ethnicities? Oh wait, the super secretive admin will never release an exact count of its following, much less a breakdown by ethnicity.

Which is funny because it's a borrowed premise from Utnapishtim's story (that was written way earlier) but made childish by turning a nuanced myth of humanity's (represented by Gilgamesh) love-hate relationship with mortality into a fable of hero = pure good vs. rest of the world = pure evil with no middle ground. I bet INC loves that dichotomy... :P

Also, the Sumerians and the Akkadians' polytheism actually reflects the reality of the universe where many equal forces / centers of power form a whole, as opposed to Hebraic monotheism which assumes just one absolute force (but also riddled with flaws and caprice if you actually think about the implications of the text, especially the events in genesis) resting on an assumed apex. In a way, it is was makes monotheism more accessible, it's simpler and more basic. Kind of like having just one big superhero instead of a team with different personalities that play off each other, even though the team option is more sophisticated and reflects reality better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/nqbqk5/midweek_worship_service_examination_jun_02_jun_04/

**My Commentary**

* [Ezekiel 18:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Ezekiel%2018:20) ([commentary](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ezekiel/18-20.htm)) and [Deuteronomy 24:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Deuteronomy%2024:16) ([commentary](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/deuteronomy/24-16.htm)) are two verses that state that no person shall die because of another's sin. However, the Bible contradicts itself because it mentions scenarios where people did die because of another person's sins; for example, in [Daniel 6:24](https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-24.htm), the wives and children of the men who falsely accused Daniel were punished as well. Furthermore, because of Adam and Eve's consumption of the forbidden fruit, mankind to this day continues to suffer. Can you guess which side INC has chosen to take, considering the number of families expelled because of one sinner? Can you guess how much, if any, Biblical evidence INC uses to support such expulsons?
   * Mind you, all of this is taking the Bible at face value, something that is highly debatable and probably better discussed on another thread.
   * Dt. 24:16 was most recently read in the [24 Jan 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/l34oea/weekend_worship_service_examination_jan_23_jan_26/) WS. Even then, IIRC, the preacher seemed to support its idea at first, but then gives no explanation as to the numerous expulsions that violate the verse.
* Going further with the deadly theme I heard, my preacher claims that parents should teach their children to be one with the administration. And yet if anyone tries to ask him if INC is a cult, he would vehemently deny it, likely with insufficient/incorrect supporting evidence (or, more likely, no evidence whatsoever).
* Like many users on this thread, my preacher claims parents should monitor their children, even after the point by which the law dictates said ""children"" are already adults. Then INC wonders why many of its younger members (and even some...not-as-young members) have lost belief/consider this ""church"" a cult.
* Despite the low quality of the hymns, the preacher, when discussing Rom. 12:1, goes on a tangent and calls out those not singing. Maybe if the hymns were at least partway decent and not overly cult-ish, more brethren would sing, but what does anyone outside the administration know...

Basically, don‚Äôt get distracted by the world, hold on to your membership, and finish the race. If you have yet to attend, prepare yourself to be eye-rolling constantly because EVM and the administration is going to be mentioned ALOT.

The first verse read, Which I believe was Revelations 3:11 was read three freaking times back to back to back in different translations just so the minister could extensively talk about not letting the world take our crown of life/membership

I recall a disgusting moment in the service where our minster talked about how people in this world strive on getting an education and working hard for things like cars or traveling around the world.  Minister than said I‚Äôm not saying those things are bad‚Ä¶ BUT‚Ä¶ If we‚Äôre busy and distracted by those things, how do we make time for the worship service and evangelical missions. Several times the minister‚Äôs opening line in a spiel started with EVM is advising us, the Administrator Is advising us.
 
Mid lesson, our minister dedicated a lot of time promoting the administration and current projects.  Apparently the administration‚Äôs latest campaign is called Intensive submission and obedience to God‚Äôs will (which we all know means EVM/Administration üòÇ).  Surprise surpise, administration has another huge money grab event planned... I recall our minister mentioning that there‚Äôs a WORLDWIDE DONATION coming up in September.  Minister even made an appeal to the brothers who are in the Kadiwa and Buklod to consider joining the ministry.

Ughhhh the prayer after the lesson.  Minister prayed for us to die as a member of the church.  When it came to the dreaded EVM portion of the prayer, Minister pleaded to God to extend EVM‚Äôs life and mentioned how EVM labors hard day and night for us.

EVM prepared lessons‚Ä¶ shameless about mentioning EVM, the administration and the divine election of the Manalo dynasty no matter the topic of the lesson.  After the FYM month, I‚Äôm kind of hoping we keep getting these EVM prepared lessons because a lot of dumb shit gets preached.

**My Comments**

* I only saw the title of the lesson on the teacher's guide; I failed to see any translations.
* The lesson is basically a guilt trip to those wishing to relinquish their office(s), if they haven't already. Trying to further your career and/or education, and/or trying to work for a living? If one or more interferes with your membership or offices, your minister/worker will guilt trip you to the point of nausea.
* Preacher mentions the numerous church activities, especially the propagation ones, thinking taking the ""broken record"" approach will make the brethren care even slightly about ""upholding their memberships.""
   * ~~I take it neither Lord Manalo nor his yes-men heard of these things called ""burnout"" or ""life outside church"" or ""not wanting your friends to question your sanity level.""~~
* 34 & 322 are the only hymns where the worshiper sings to Christ (34) or God (322). The rest are lecture hymns, with 9; 109 & 150 all having lyrics about being devoted in one's duties in the church (not to mention the glaringly obvious titles of 9 & 150). 150 goes further with the lyric, ""Never think your sacrifices are useless,"" despite (or more likely because of) the contradictory belief of the more cynical brethren. 218 doubles as a submission hymn, ending on a lyric about remaining in the church.
   * ~~It's like Lord Manalo himself made this lineup!~~
   * ~~218 might as well be titled ""We Will Study the Words of Manalo"".~~

Cherry picked verses once again that they use to suite their own interpretation that their members clearly are blinded and in reality don‚Äôt trust that Jesus Christ loves them and know their HEARTS intentions. Manalo preaching reads parts of scriptures of Jesus Christ then they interpret it in their own way of preaching. I followed the verse that they read and it‚Äôs only a small portion on what Jesus Christ goal was. The INC ministers cut and paste the gospel of Jesus Christ in their twisted knowledge from the Administration teachings. Never and I say NEVER the INC will ever reveal the truth about Jesus Christ‚Äôs gospel that‚Äôs in the New Testament of the Holy Bible!!!!! Jesus Christ‚Äôs Birth, Miracle‚Äôs, persecution, crucifixion, resurrection, and LOVE for all is what real Christian‚Äôs hearts need to nourish. The INC‚Äôs money hungry preaching and brainwashed ways must stop!!! I feel the new generation of youth in the INC will get inspired by the gospel of Jesus Christ and sway away from the whole Manalo gospel because of the Internet that the IGLESIA NI Christo is so very afraid of, and of the past in 2015 that the INC has encountered that led its Manalo leader to disown his Mother. LOVE, LOVE and LOVE of Jesus Christ‚Äôs gospel will conquer all, instead of Manalo‚Äôs TOXIC teachings of offering, membership, and administration/Manalo preaching.",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/nxwzew/weekend_worship_service_examination_jun_12_jun_15/

**My Comments**

* My preacher withheld all translations of the verses read. For the sake of context and readability, entries with multiple verses lead to the NKJV translation, with all verses appearing in the order (or lack thereof) in which the preacher read them. I was not able to see the teacher's guide this WS.
* Preacher also claims the so-called detractors supposedly never succeeded and never will (Where's a lie detector when you need one?).
* Why did I say, ""Mentioned Only"" in the Deadly Themes entry? A quick skim of today's verses would show no obvious Deadly Theme, meaning that the preacher violated [Deut. 12:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Deuteronomy%2012:32) and [Rev. 22:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Revelation%2022:18) by adding to the supposedly pristine doctrine that is the Holy Bible.

Couldn‚Äôt exactly catch the title of the lesson, I think it was about how to live a happy and secure life yet the lesson is all about obeying the administration.  Our minister was such a blatant administration shill and the lesson was unashamedly cultic about the administration.

Minister plays up to it, kicking off the lesson that children must obey their parents (but our supreme Lord EVM did his mother dirtyüò¶).  Once the transition from children obeying parents to parents obeying the Administration happens, rest of the lesson is all about the administration.  At this point in the lesson, other than verses being read, literally every single sentence said by the minister included either administration or EVM.

"Weekend Worship Service Examination (Jun 26 - Jun 29, 2021)",o82gdl,2021-06-25,"First part of the lesson is all about INC is the true church as they build up to Acts 20:28 LAMSA. I‚Äôve noticed that they don‚Äôt bother to mention which translation is being used for verses nowadays and minister did not cite which translation of Acts 20:28 was being used.

Acts 20:28 Lamsa ‚ùåChurch of Christ? ‚úÖchurch of Christ

INC is using an abomination of a translation and are intentionally lying to its members that ‚ÄúChurch of Christ‚Äù is in the Bible when it‚Äôs really the phrase ‚Äúchurch of Christ"" which only occurs ONCE in Lamsa. Plus Lamsa was published two decades after Felix Manaloko, a messenger of the Devil, registered his business. Unfortunately, this simple truth fails to reach members because the Bible is a mystery and only ministers can interpret it and EVM + administration keeps reminding everyone that internet is bad.  

Second half of the lesson is about watching your tongue and to not speak up or criticize the administration.  Minister mentioned not to gossip, which is hilarious considering that‚Äôs what INC members are guilty off whenever they gather together outside of church and even inside church.  Minister went on and on about not broadcasting disputes outside the church, keep it within the church, bring problems to locale leadership/ministers.  

Of course if someone does speak up against the church, INC wants you to disown them completely, even if they are your literal family‚Ä¶

Hmmm, what else do I remember about the worshit service.  As usual, majority of members don‚Äôt sing hymns or answer in prayer lol.  Ughh It irks me whenever the minister spontaneously speaks a phrase in Tagalog in the middle of an English WS not a Filipino church though ü§°Our minister also addressed our nonexistent guests lol ‚Äúif we have any guests here‚Ä¶‚Äù cmon dude, we can‚Äôt even get a single guest for bible studies 90% of the time üòÇ",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/o82gdl/weekend_worship_service_examination_jun_26_jun_29/

My preacher withheld all translations of the verses used, but (for reasons that are probably better kept secret) that didn't stop me.

* INC: ""Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him"" ([I John 3:15 NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=I+John+3%3A15&version=NIV)).
   * Also INC: ""Oh, EVM? He does not hate anyone, especially not his own family! He is not and never will be a murderer! In fact, he loves the church so much! He does so much for the church that we cannot begin to name the things he does for it!""
* This lesson appears to have been outlined by EVM himself. If that's so, why doesn't he attempt to prove he isn't a murderer? Or at least admit he is one by his own logic? I'll tell you why: he knows the very nanosecond he does either action, he will justify the thoughts of the so-called detractors!
* I'm not sure if this counts for the Deadly Themes, but the administration was mentioned (to no one's surprise).
* How many times just this year has the lesson mentioned something about work and/or school?

We need your help serving subpoenas now that the Texas Court of Appeals ‚Äúreversed, and remanded‚Äù our death threats sanctioned by LLDM. The Court pointed out LLDM-Austin‚Äôs prior criminal act of stealing free El Mundo newspapers containing our law office‚Äôs ad as an indication of their behavior, certainly worthy of discovery. Austin PD refused to investigate, and sneered claiming you ‚Äúcan‚Äôt steal a free newspaper‚Äù.  
  
I sneered back that the criminals who stole UT‚Äôs ‚ÄúDaily Texan‚Äù were convicted of a misdemeanor crime, and was told ‚ÄúUT is different‚Äù. Then, I asked if the officer takes contraband Steroids, and he told me to go away.  
  
The problem with serving the subpoenas is the Joaquin boys have scattered, and seem to be evading process. I will need your services. Behave this time.  
  
If you can‚Äôt handle it, we‚Äôre going to call Shorty Rossi‚Äôs friend Dog, the Bounty Hunter. We understand, for $50k he‚Äôll serve anyone we want. We‚Äôre still waiting for celebrity offerings to him, but need to set up a 501(c)(3), or else get someone else‚Äôs accountant to handle paying Dog‚Äôs boys to serve Naason Joaquin‚Äôs brothers. We have unserved citations still pending in Guadalupe County in our Rule 202. Covid has been a nightmare in delays.  
  
La Luz Del Mundo Cult evasions of process serving subpoenas to Joaquin family members: Benjamin, Naason, Eva, Atlai, Naason‚Äôs wife, and my fav, Adoniram, the recent assassin over drug money stolen from a LLDM coyote.  
  
We‚Äôll spoon feed law enforcement enough evidence that they can‚Äôt ignore it without a CNN soundbite asking why. Univision asked for an update yesterday. They were told LLDM is an ‚Äúopen investigation‚Äù, and to not report, for now. It‚Äôs been ‚Äúopen‚Äù since the 1980‚Äôs. We‚Äôre about to ‚Äúclose‚Äù it through the media.  
  
Chances are LEOs will suddenly be interested in ‚Äúcollateral damage‚Äù rape victims left behind all these years. If not, we‚Äôll find a media source in Europe that won‚Äôt have the political ties police control here in Central Texas.

INC is the true church, treasure membership be active for salvation, Obey administration and Lord EVM, don‚Äôt be distracted by the world, prepare offerings for anniversary thanksgiving

Ministers in my area never cite translations anymore not even Acts 20:28, so I had to figure out the translation after WS, but I believe it was Proverbs 4:25 MSG translation that the minister read about ‚Äúside show distractions‚Äù.  Our minister was saying some braindead things like the devil distracts us with poverty and financial hardships (FFS INCult is responsible for this) The devil tries to distract us with fallen members lying and slandering the church and the administration. 

The past worship services have been so mind numbingly redundant. It‚Äôs literally the same lesson but they just slap on a different title and cycle in different cherry picked verses.

So it's basically like a lesson on repeat but longer and more EVM special mentions.

Of course there's no INC without Acts 20:28 Lamsa. (Search for ""Gawa 20:28 Lamsa"" on google and you'll get INC websites on the results)

The last part of the lesson, by the way the minister said it, made it sound like the devil is the one that cares more for our well being than God. 

""The devil uses poverty to lead us astray by finding us a solution for it"" Or something like that. So if the devil can do it, why won't God do it?

Of course thanksgiving was mentioned as well so we were reminded again to bring ""voluntarity"" offerings (a lot of offerings I'm sure because ""sulong"")

I was at a different lokale. I saw a ""We Love EVM"" decoration there as I was leaving the chapel after WS. I thought ""But not God or Jesus?"".

The lesson had a focus on offerings especially with the upcoming Thanksgiving offering.  Once again the minister talked about poverty, financial hardships, loss of a job, and somehow that equates to giving more offering. The lesson also put a lot of focus in trying to guilt trip and spiritually blackmail members into becoming more active in missionary activities, bible studies, and works of propagation in order to be saved. Our minister was heavily implying that God won't listen to our prayers and we won't be saved if we just simply attend the worship service and are content with doing the bare minimum as a member.

EVM and Family once again were the only ones the minister prayed for when it comes to protection, health and strength from their cult god.

FYM is the messenger on these last days BS again and them using that Isaiah prophecy as ""solid proof"" (Hebrews 1:2 be damned despite being clearly written on the bible on most, if not all translations).

Acts 20:28 (Lamsa translation I assume) was used again as ""solid proof"". That's like 3 WS in a row now since going back to f2f.

Anniversaries for a number of locales, Minister ordination, but other than that, the motive of the PPV is to ultimately rally members to continue giving everything they can when it comes to offering, to give as much as possible just like the people of Macedonia. 

EVM does not fool me, first part of the lesson is filled with filler fluff about worshipping the true god, God can make the impossible possible, etc.  EVM is trying to hard to spiritually appeal to the members because  after the serving God talk, EVM jumps into offerings,

EVM was boasting about how other religions are failing, INC is buying their houses or worship.  Apparently INC spent over 6 billion Pesos (~120 million US Dollars) on houses of worships of the past year, which is thanks to INC members.  He acknowledges that members of INC are poor and then really focuses on Macedonia in the bible telling us that even though people of Macedonia were in extreme poverty, they gave everything they possibly can because they are true believers.  Members are poor but still give everything you can like the true believers of the first century church of Christ in Macedonia.

EVM of course said alot of dumb things like he always does.  I remember he opened the lesson telling us that people of the world look down on us as if we're 2nd class citizens... seriously?  If anything it's the other way around....  EVM at one point equated integrity to obedience lol.  I believe when EVM was bragging about how other religions are failing he actually mentioned he didn't bring proof lol.. Countless freaking Tuloys.  Longer than usual prayers that give special attention to EVM and gushing over him + the hysterical sobbing of some members... Oh can't forget the cringe fake prayer EVM always does at the end of the lesson.

* Main Deadly Themes: Other Religions Are Wrong, Don't Leave the INC
   * Offerings were given their own part (2 Cor. 8:1-4); The Administration was briefly mentioned, as well.

* Job 42:1-2
* Genesis 17:1
* Luke 1:37
* Hebrews 11:6
* Psalms 78:8, 11, 19-22
* Job 4:5-6
* 2 Corinthians 4:7
* Hebrews 11:29, 30, 32, 33
* 2 Corinthians 8:1-4
* Luke 18:28-30

**Just for Fun/My Comments and Observations**

* You guessed it! No translations were named in this PPV.
* Total PPV length: 1 hour, 45 minutes
* Sermon length: 58 minutes
* Tuloy Tally: 56
   * Almost 1 ""Tuloy!"" per minute! (For those who don't know, ""Tuloy!"" means, ""Continue!"" in Tagalog/Filipino.)
* Prayer Approximations and Stats:
   * Officers' Prayer: 4 min.
   * Opening Prayer: 6 min.
   * Post-Lesson Prayer: 9 min.
   * Post-Ordination Prayer: 6 min.
   * Officers' Prayer: 2 min.
   * Total: 27 min.
   * In each of the five prayers, Jesus Christ gets less than a minute of mention. The final officers' prayer is possibly the only one in which Christ gets more prayer time than EVM.
* EVM attempts to answer the brethren's question of, ""Why are we still learning this if we already know it?"" with the Psalms 78 verses.
* After the reading of 2 Corin. 4:7, EVM goes on a tangent to mention some of INC's so-called victories, such as:
   * INC is not diminishing, unlike other religions. *(Based on what metric(s)?)*
   * In fact, INC was able to add three districts, 81 congregations, and 325 group WSes. *(How many of each of those subdivisions are just, for example, one district becoming two, a congregation splitting into two or more, so forth?)*
   * 180 former pastors, preachers, etc. joined INC. *(And how many INC ministers/workers renounced the ministry or even outright left? In fact, how many of those 180 did a 180¬∞ and left INC?)*
   * My point is EVM and the administration can present whatever they want and it would still technically qualify as fact, but will they ever present or even acknowledge evidence to the contrary?
* I might be overanalyzing, but during the opening prayer, the minister claims something along the lines of, ""Almost half a year has passed."" Taken at face value, such a statement would imply this particular worship service occurred in late June at the absolute latest, meaning the administration just recycled a month-old, or perhaps older, WS.
* Near the end of the sermon, EVM says, ""I will not prolong my preaching any further"" (or something to that effect), but then prattles for a good six or seven more minutes before finally standing the brethren for the prayer.
* EVM himself admits the brethren are poor *~~(Hmmm I wonder why that is...)~~*.

**Hymns**

* 64: ""Would I Still Be Worthy?""
* 320: ""Your Goodness is Abounding and without End""
   * ‚Ä¶except when it isn't...
* [428: ""I'm Proud to Be a Member of the Church of Christ""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc9Zrv25mOc)

   * showtune
* 510: ‚ÄúOur Lord God Will Act for Us""
   * has these lyrics in the 2nd stanza: ""Do not dwell in anguish or deep distress/Do not let depression take hold."" Can you guess the theme of this ""hymn""? *(This part was taken directly from* [*my comment*](https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/of0h7o/july_2021_lineups/h49h1y8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) *on the* [*July 2021 lineups*](https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/of0h7o/july_2021_lineups/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)*.)*
   * Not helping is the lyric: ""...all his commandments obey/Prove to our Father we truly believe/By never turning away.""
   * Still not helping is its similarities to 466 (""Rejoice in Your Suffering"") from a few years ago:
      * same key (F major with many D minor chords for emotional effect)
      * same time signature (6/4)
      * similar messages (don't let trials etc. take hold of you)
* [71: ""My Journey in This Life""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNlWuno2-Q4)
   * includes a lyric about obedience
* 482: ""He Is Returning, So Let Us Prepare""
   * includes the lyric: ""to His Church, be faithful and be true""
   * showtune-sounding
* 294: ""We Must Defend Our Election""

* Hymn 79 includes lyrics about grace that only Christ can bestow. However, many if not all ministers and workers will likely substitute EVM for Christ, then insist that INC will never contradict the Bible. How these preachers don‚Äôt seem to question such practices, I‚Äôll never understand.
* I still don‚Äôt understand how INC expects 6 converts per household when its self-service and other cult tactics would repel any rational-minded person. Maybe a minister or worker could (or at least delude himself into thinking said campaign is reasonable)?

2nd part of the lesson, minister just ranted about people that leave the church.

This time, the lesson's all about glorifying EVM. Because Sept 7 was that day EVM finally inherited his grandfather's brainwashing business I think. 

It started with the lesson saying that the church is expanding and increasing in members again (w/o proof).

Then how INC carried on their services despite the pandemic (that's only because they force and guilt trip their members into doing it. Even going as far as putting their members at risk of getting covid just to have F2F services again).

Then comes the glorification of our beloved supreme leader EVM. 

We were then told via a (butchered) Bible verse that we should consider other people (EVM in particular I'm sure) more important than ourselves. Then how we should make our leaders happy, make EVM happy!

By doing propagation, we make EVM happy (because more members means more money and power for him of course). Also it apparently means that we get our names written in their so called (Manalo's) Book of Life.

Oh how we should pray for and Love that greedy cash loving, fear mongering sunovabich who just happens to get that Executive Minister position just because he is one of the Manalos! 

By becoming one with the administration, you'll get the benefit of losing money and time as well as free mental tortures for years to come. Yes, EVM's Love sure is genuine! 

May this lesson serves as an encouragement for all of us (to leave this sorry cult once and for all). Heil Manalo! Manalo akbar! Manalo Banzai!

* Never forsake the worship service. Even if it‚Äôs the cause of your problems?
* EVM acknowledges the world‚Äôs current problems prove out of the ordinary. But he and his admin still won‚Äôt just let us leave this blasted cult‚Ä¶
* In spite of the above problems, EVM instructs the brethren never to take offense in the giving of offerings.
   * He claims INC members don‚Äôt take offense to the giving of offerings. Think again, EVM! (Is he even capable of thinking?)
* Once again, EVM says (or at least tries to say) a thing or two about depression, even though he knows not the first thing about it.
* EVM claims that a duty in the church is a ‚Äúgift‚Äù from ‚ÄúGod.‚Äù I think whoever wrote his script misspelled ‚Äúburden‚Äù and ‚Äúthe administration.‚Äù
* To me at least, there were times it felt like the sermon was about to conclude, but EVM and the reader forced more verses down everyone‚Äôs throats. I hate fake endings‚Ä¶
* EVM claims we should also help out those outside the church. He forgot to include ‚Äúbut not the dEtRaCtOrS!‚Äù
* I wonder how many of those 669 new ministers/workers will quit in the near future‚Ä¶
   * I also wonder just how many of them were voluntold for the ministry.
   * ~~If only 3 fewer of them had joined this go-around‚Ä¶~~
* In the closing prayer, the minister claims something like, ‚Äú[God has] turned this pandemic for the good of [his] nation.‚Äù Like‚Ä¶what?
* I love how, after the ordination excerpt, the video doesn‚Äôt tell you to stand for the post-ordination prayer. Caught my locale off-guard!
* The entire fiasco lasted 1 hour, 42 minutes, including both officers‚Äô prayers (not including circulars). What happened to ‚Äúquality over quantity‚Äù?

**Hymns**

Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶

* generic officers‚Äô prayer (22: ‚ÄúOur Fervent Prayers‚Äù)
* distorted praise hymn (13: ~~‚ÄùO Father, Hear Our Praise‚Äù~~ ‚ÄúOh , We Praise You, Father‚Äù)
* obedience/submission hymn (442: ‚ÄúSteadfast, We Will Stand on Your Love and Words‚Äù)
* obedience/submission hymn [again] ([356: ‚ÄúMy Loyalty to You Will Never Change‚Äù](https://youtu.be/puLIRjumVbw)
* duty/obedience hymn (6: ~~‚ÄùIn This Duty, I Have Found My Salvation‚Äù~~ ‚ÄúMy Salvation Rests in My Duty‚Äù
* lecture/obedience hymn that namedrops both the messenger and admin (398: ‚ÄúHold onto the Words of God‚Äù)
* During the ordination excerpt, that hymn that makes many people cry briefly plays (246: ‚ÄúI Offer My Strength and Life‚Äù, a.k.a. ‚ÄúNever Will I Leave Your Church‚Äù)
* 6 voice Doxology (2 soprano voices, 2 tenor voices in addition to alto & bass) because regular SATB apparently isn‚Äôt good enough anymore
* lecture showtune (285: ‚ÄúWe Must Be on Guard‚Äù)
   * (Ideally, this *should* have been the end of the pain-per-view, but nope! Stick around for the officers‚Äô prayer [even if you‚Äôre not one!] and one or more circulars [the one about not buying unauthorized INC merch, maybe others depending on local/district.])
* Nope, nothing to see here with these ‚Äúhymns‚Äù but a ginormous waste of trees and ink!
* Couldn‚Äôt they have at least done this at the last weekend of the month to spare us from [‚ÄúI Am a Member‚Äù](https://youtu.be/6jtvxZ_fay8)?

* Worldwide donation is this weekend, so open those wallets, drain those bank accounts, and break open those piggybanks! ~~EVM‚Äôs cash flow~~ The church and its needs are at stake here, the minister/worker might as well say.
* Some worldwide event (I already forgot what exactly it is) is set to occur on (or around) ~~Halloween~~ Mr. Manalo‚Äôs birthday, so mark those calendars (so you‚Äôll know when to shut off your phone and pretend you‚Äôre not home)!
* Let‚Äôs not forget that BeAr SiX fRuItS campaign the admin has forced down our throats! So if I bring a teddy bear and six oranges to church, am I good?
* Now please stand for ‚Äú[I Am a Member](https://youtu.be/6jtvxZ_fay8)‚Äù! If you were hoping your minister or worker would forget, chances are he‚Äôll let you down.
   * Other hymns today include:
      * a showtune about the messenger (that segues into a lecture/duty hymn near the end, and even includes a lyric about the church) [401: ‚ÄúThe Last Work of Salvation‚Äù]
      * an obedience/submission hymn that sounds‚Ä¶less than happy [[437: ‚ÄúTo You, Lord Jesus, I Offer My Heart‚Äù](https://youtu.be/tStjHPL37tE)]
      * an obedience hymn about remaining in the church (and even includes a shoutout to the DeTrAcToRs!) [458: ‚ÄúI Will Hold Fast the Election the Have‚Äù]
      * an obedience hymn before the text (that starts off sounding like a CWS hymn and segues into sounding like a showtune) [363: ‚ÄúOur Souls Wait Eagerly‚Äù]

Luke 11:45-46 NIV

One of the experts in the law answered him, ‚ÄúTeacher, when you say these things, you insult us also.‚Äù Jesus replied, ‚ÄúAnd you experts in the law, woe to you, because you LOAD PEOPLE DOWN WITH BURDENS they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.

In Jesus brief ministry here amongst humans, He hung out with the sinners, sick and just basically repentant broken humans like me. His woes are aimed directly at the same folks who eventually got him killed. No other than the false preachers themselves.

I have said it before. The preacher profession is the only job that came with a biblical warning from Jesus Himself. Beware of false preachers/prophets. That‚Äôs a 50/50 chance.

Also don't feel bad when you don't become propsperous by doing ""good things"" (which, for INC is offering a lot, obeying the Church Admin, attending WS, intensive provocation and propagation, intensive brainwashing for life) because wealth is temporary (hear that EVM? WEALTH IS TEMPORARY! You can't bring all that money you extorted from your followers to hell you know)

Also my dad is starting to question the lessons. He's staring to notice that the lessons are all about submitting to the church admin more than God.",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/q2bq2l/midweek_worship_service_examination_oct_06_oct_08/

Our beloved executive minister who labors day and night for us.  Or as the lesson was hyping up his newest title, the lesson was about ‚ÄúThe Watchman‚Äù. This lesson is just blasphemous sick idolatry of EVM

My goodness, of course his birthday is coming up but Iglesia ni Cristo?  More like Iglesia ni Eduardo Manalo‚Ä¶ this lesson talked about the executive minister so much.  Lesson spent a lot of time talking about and then hyping up EVM as ‚ÄúThe Watchman‚Äù.  This guy‚Äôs ego smh, coining himself a new title just before his birthday.   I don‚Äôt even recall a single mention of Jesus in the lesson.  Sure Christ was mentioned a couple times but it was only mentioned when talking about church of Christ.

Lesson also talked about to not be deceived by the Devil and false prophets üòÇ.  Of course the most important commandment of Iglesia ni Eduardo Manalo, giving offering was covered in depth.

Boasting of Church Chapels that the INC has built and Boasting of how other churches are not successful. What Church of Jesus would boast about their riches??? The answer is the Iglesia Ni Christo of Eduardo Manalo Administration. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is not being boasted about. Jesus Christ‚Äôs Gospel even say‚Äôs to Boast of him and not earthly things. The TOXIC teachings of God sending Felix, Eranyo, and Eduardo for the sake of our salvation is totally Satans work as they preach of Satan working hard in this world. Yes the Devil is working hard and his name is Eduardo Manalo!!!! Imagine guys or members of the INC, the recognizing of Eduardo‚Äôs birthday is coming up is so CULTISH that it‚Äôs members are so brainwashed that they‚Äôve truly praise Eduardo more than Jesus Christ. I‚Äôm sure the INC members will praise his Birthday like it‚Äôs a blessing from God that he is an Executive Minister. Today‚Äôs preaching is so Toxic that the ministers manipulation of the Bible said that offering is a commandment of GOD, and the setting aside of money is a Duty. No preaching of Jesus‚Äôs true Gospel on how he is the way, the truth, and the life. No preaching of knowing of Jesus Christ is the only way to God. No preaching of to Boast of Jesus Christ. The INC‚Äôs preachings love to boast of beautiful Chapels and member numbers. This type of mentality is of the Devil that they‚Äôve been preaching about. Also they want the members to prepare money as Eduardo‚Äôs birthday is coming this weekend. That‚Äôs truly non-biblical and truly go against the true preaching of the Holy Bible. Once again the repetitive preaching of setting aside of money and no preaching of Christ Jesus‚Äôs Gospel. The preaching of Eduardo‚Äôs hard labor is so Toxic that it‚Äôs like he sacrificed his life for our sins. Jesus Christ‚Äôs true Gospel has not been spoken the fact that Jesus is our Savior. The INC brainwashed its members to believe that Eduardo is a Savior. They speak of the Devil and Satan but don‚Äôt look in the mirror because they manipulated and brainwashed it‚Äôs members to believe that Eduardo is a SAVIOR. But only Jesus Christ can save us through his Gospel. I‚Äôm so Glad that this Subreddit was created so all people and members can see how the manipulation and Toxic preaching of the INC is False, and their main goal in its ministry is for money. I hope and pray that more INC members can find Jesus Christ‚Äôs Gospel so that they‚Äôll see the misinterpretation and False preaching of the Iglesia Ni Christo.

"Weekend Worship Service Examination (Oct 30 - Nov 02, 2021)",qiska8,2021-10-29,"**Foreword**

Happy Halloween to all! (Hmm...I think it *just might* also be the birthday of he-who-shall-not-yet-be-named...) To celebrate, I have decided to type up a very informal overview compared to my write-ups earlier this month, so happy reading!

(Oh, and EVM, if you're reading this, thanks. Thanks a lot. Thank you for proving what a massive hypocrite you are and never admitting fault. Thanks again, in case your ministers and workers somehow don't tell you enough.)

**Sermon**

* Main Topics: obedience to ~~Manalo's~~ God's word, ""It'S nOt EnOuGh To Be A mEmBeR""
* Deadly Themes: Mention of ""Social Media against the Church"" and ""Other Religions Are Wrong""

**Verses Used**

* Matthew 16:26
* Psalm 119:105 *(Read in Translation for Translators and The Message)*
* 1 Peter 1:10-11, 18-19
* Acts 20:28 *(No mention of translation, but of course the preacher still read, ""church of Christ"")*
* Isaiah 2:3 *(Whichever translation was used included, ""Yahweh,"" even though, unless I'm mistaken, INC does not recognize such a term.)*
* 1 Corinthians 1:26-29
* Zephaniah 1:17
* 1 Timothy 6:3-5 *(Social Media mentioned here)*
* Hebrews 3:12-14
* 1 Timothy 6:12
* Revelation 3:10-11
* Psalm 149:43-44, 33-38
* Ephesians 1:16-19

**Prayer Approximations & Breakdowns**

* Officers' Opening Prayer
   * Time Spent Praying to Christ: \~30 sec. (11.81%)
   * Time Spent Praying for Manalo: \~1 min. (23.62%)
   * Total: \~4:14
* Opening Prayer
   * Christ: \~10s (3.06%)
   * Manalo: \~30s (9.17%)
   * Total: \~5:27
* Closing Prayer
   * Christ: \~40s (7.84%)
   * Manalo: \~1:30 to 1:40 (17.65% to 19.61%)
   * Total: \~8:30
* Officers' Closing Prayer
   * Christ: \~10s (9.09%)
   * Manalo: \~17s (15.45%)
   * Total: \~1:50
* Totals
   * Christ: \~1:30 (7.49%)
   * Manalo \~3:17 to 3:27 (16.40% to 17.24%)
   * Total: \~20:01

Lo and behold, the ministers spent more than twice as much time (more specifically, 2.19x to 2.30x as much) praying for Manalo than they did praying to, you know, *the deity that (supposedly) founded the church.* (Thankfully, there was no ordination, which would have meant a fifth prayer \[and more time to kiss up to EVM.\])

**Hymns**

* 135: ""I Draw Near to You""
* 325: ""Constantly, Give Him Our Joyful Praise""
   * this showtune sounds like 3 different showtunes haphazardly combined
* 489: ""People of ~~Manalo~~ God, Give Him Glory""
   * You might remember this lecture showtune from its debut in the Dec. 2019 thanksgiving...or not, especially if you flat out dislike this ""church's"" ""hymns""
   * Right off the bat, the lyrics go:
      * *There is no doubt whatsoever,/There is surely no mistake/In deciding to join this church,/Where we steadfastly remain;*
      * Hmm...I thought ""God"" ""calls"" people into this ""church""
      * I'm sure tens of thousands, possibly more, of people would disagree with these lyrics.
      * If ""we steadfastly remain,"" then why are so many people leaving, trying to leave, and/or being expelled?
* 494: ""Lord ~~EVM~~ Jesus, Help Me So That I Can Persevere""
   * emotional guilt trip:
      * 1st stanza is basically ""world = bad""
      * 3rd stanza includes lyrics about obedience: *""I am resolved and ready to stand firm and sure/In full obedience, to patiently endure;""*
* Processional 1: ""Indeed, We Are So Joyful""
   * Yup, INC has processional hymns dedicated to, well, the dedication of houses of worship.
   * This one in particular sounds like a CWS hymn, and seems to double as a submission hymn.
* Processional 2: ""Father, in Our House of Worship""
   * claims: *""In worship service, our strength is restored*,*""* despite many feeling drained by the WS
   * obedience hymn
* 373: ""If We Truly Are Obedient""
   * Real subtle...also didn't we just have this ""hymn"" fairly recently ([29 Aug 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/ovcdt3/comment/h9s53xw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))?
* 290: ""Let's Submit Completely to Our Lord ~~Manalo~~ Jesus""
* Even though this is the last weekend of Oct., there was no ""[I Am a Member](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jtvxZ_fay8)"". SOP dictates that unless the PPV cuts off before the 30-minute mark of EVM's sermon, the hymn won't be sung on PPVs that fall on the last weekend of the month.

**Other Comments/Observations/Stray Thoughts**

* Total PPV Length: 1 hour, 36 minutes
* Sermon: 56 minutes
* Tuloy Tally/Continue Count: 53 (Stick around for a stroll down Memory Lane!)
* Why exactly does EVM need 5 other ministers (excluding his reader) in the pulpit area? Do they not have other things they could be doing?
* EVM claims other religions are losing fervor in their services and have lost understanding of the truth. And this ""religion"" hasn't?
* If, per EVM, INC has managed to avoid discrimination, then how did it end up mostly Filipino?
* EVM mentions a preacher from another religion who would tell a story after reading a verse. Does he not do just that as well?
   * He quips that a person listening to said preacher likely would not understand the verse after the story. EVM, have you heard of this thing called ""a mirror""?
* Apparently EVM says constant prayers. Barring the Manalo mantra at the end of his sermons and the benediction, when does he let the brethren witness such ""prayers""?
   * Part of his supposedly constant prayers include his hopes that the brethren remain in their divine election. Well, who else would kiss up to him at all opportunities?

* Hymn 154 (verse 2): ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sin to cause offense.‚Äù
   * What they really mean: ‚ÄúIf your last name is Manalo/It‚Äôs required to cause offense.‚Äù [If you sing ‚Äúrequired‚Äù as 2 syllables, then it fits the melody!]
* Hymn 394 (refrain): ‚ÄúRid yourself of all bitterness/And, from spiteful words, refrain.‚Äù
   * ‚ÄúThose‚Äù members (Especially you, EVM!!): ‚ÄúThese lyrics don‚Äôt apply to me, do they? Even if they do, I‚Äôll pretend I heard nothing.‚Äù
* I mentioned before that 394 is basically a mixture of 57 (‚ÄúMay Our Lips Be Holy‚Äù) & 154. Why the music dept. continues to do the ‚Äúsame message, different ‚Äòhymn‚Äô ‚Äú thing, especially on lecture ‚Äúhymns,‚Äù I‚Äôll never know.
   * Also, doesn‚Äôt this suggest lecture hymns don‚Äôt work? In fact, why not just throw out the whole hymnal (if it can even be called that) to make the WS that much shorter?
* I love how, as distorted as 186 has become, it seems partway decent (read: not quite as bad but still not really good) by comparison to the hymns it‚Äôs sandwiched between (including the before text & recessional hymns).

"Weekend Worship Service Examination (Nov 20 - Nov 23, 2021)",qxw7um,2021-11-19,"INC being all doomsday cult once again. This must be one of the worst WS I've ever attended.

Total EVM Mentions: 2 

Money offered: 1 (I regretted it after hearing today's lessons and they were watching me too)

Nap/Daydream Rating: 5/10 - It was relaxing at first but then the minister started guilt tripping. Couldn't sleep after that.

Cringe Rating: 3/10 - INC being all doom and gloom slightly cringes me.

Trigger Rating: 10/10: - Let me rant here for a second:

This minister starts saying that those who aren't helping ""God's works of salvation"" are lazy (Really asshole?). He stresses the work of Propagation and Offering more than anything else. How each individual should have 20 converts within 3 years. (I read about it here but to actually hear it from him? WTF?). How we should help meet their locale's ""target"" (aka quota of converts). How offerings in WS aren't enough, and we should give lagaks and ""special offerings too"" then announces ""worldwide offerings"". (Kiss my ass minister). Lastly, the cherry on top was the minister saying don't expect any gratitude from doing these works. (Screw them! If that's the case then  EVM shouldn't be getting any thanks as well).

Based from what I heard from INC's brainwashing session

- Intensive propagation - /
- ""Voluntary"" offerings - /
- Only INC will be saved - /
- Attend WS - /
- INC ""Successes"" - /
- End of the world (Second Coming) - /
- World is terrible - /
- Hardships - /
- Don't focus on this life - /
- Salvation - /

CWS (King Saul envies David) lessons were a little bit concerning especially their ""moral lesson"" part. They say that even if God's chosen servants (leaders) do wrong, we shouldn't raise our hands against them.

That means that no matter how many evil deeds EVM does, we shouldn't fight him because ""God chose him"". Damn...

Also the finance officers in the locale are being a bunch of cranky assholes today (aka masungit, probably because of the pressure from their cult higher ups). This cult sucks big time.

Not even 50 feels out of place to me. My guess is that the title makes me think that they will sound similar to something like 262 and 93 but they sound relatively similar to something like 435.

Minister also says we don't pay for salvation because (reads a bible verse) we can never pay for salvation. Instead, we pay for our ""vows"" or ""panata"". I don't exactly know what the f*** that means. Doesn't change the fact that we are still paying for our salvation here in INC. Where does the money go to? Heaven? Of course they won't tell us.

Then surprise surprise! They gave a shout out to Macedonia again! He says they weren't forced to give more than what they have then proceeds to tell us to make sure that we ""sulong"" in this YETG (meaning to make sure that offerings this TG is more than last TG, greedy sunovabitches!)

Right behind CWS TG DEC (I‚Äôll explain that in the future). Probably because the lesson was basically just a culmination of previous lessons and honestly because of that I just stopped caring. Also my uncle taught the lecture this time so it‚Äôs short and therefore more tolerable. Also the songs. While I am disappointed that 504 has no S1, everything else is pretty great. 508 has grown on me (as does literally every song that comes from them), 504 is still super fun to sing, and yeah I thoroughly had a good time with this one. Now of course it has flaws. Big flaws. It‚Äôs a culmination of the garbage we‚Äôve been hearing for the past few weeks (excluding the homophobic sections thankfully), mainly offering and world-ending, and honestly my positivity towards this WS completely leans on the fact that it‚Äôs short but that‚Äôs really what helped this one. Most worship services follow a pattern where I get lots of enjoyment in the singing portion but all that enjoyment gets completely cancelled out by the garbage lecture section. With the lesson being short this time, it didn‚Äôt have enough time to rid my enjoyment of the songs. I feel sorry though for the people in other locations having to deal with this culmination of everything but it‚Äôs inflated. Comparing my uncle‚Äôs time to get through the lecture with a regular lecture from my home locale really put things into perspective on how unnecessarily long most of the lectures are.

"Weekend Worship Service Examination (Dec 24 - Dec 27, 2021)",rnnz1j,2021-12-24,"Just got out from the most important person in the world's 90 minute therapy session.   
It appears that Big Ed is not pleased; Big Ed is not happy; actually Big Ed is angry.  
For a so-called ""Thanksgiving"" service one would think that the service would reflect on 2021; You know... acknowledge the events, be thankful for the good things, look forward to the future, etc.   

But nope.  That's not quite the case here.  This particular shitshow was pretty much a 50-minute rant from the Executive Minister of the Church of the Church Administration (Eduardo V. Manalo).  Eduardo started off with patting himself on the back with some stats about the current achievements of the church since 2009:  4,200+ churches built,  6,200 minions produced, 10,000 more minions coming soon (so basically, he high fived ... himself?! Who does that?!).

This was then followed up by the signature doom and gloom, the world is going to shit spiel.  Big Ed talks about disasters conflicts and other unfortunate events ""around the world"".  He makes it a point to mention tornadoes in the United States and nothing more.  Yes, because nothing bad happens elsewhere but in the US.  Not sure if you noticed Eddie, but aside from being a perrenially poor country, the Philippines in 2021 had to continue to deal with COVID19, a volcanic eruption (Taal) and several typoons (one of which was quite recent),  also don't forget the usual crime and corruption ;-)  You do know of those things... right?

Then comes the meat of the show, ""OFFERING"".  No need to beat a dead horse.  There was a shout out to the ""offended"", ""to those who try to convince others not to give"", ""to those online, in the tubes of the interwebz - r/exInglesiaNiCristo ?""

 Big Ed proceeds on a 30 minute tirade about how ""You should/need/must offer.""  No mention of  ""giving by your heart's desire"" or that story of poor old widow who only had two coins that equated to half a cent.  Just Give, Bitch. Pay up!  

You can tell that the most important person in the world seems to be agitated by the elevated tone in his voice when talking about money.  

I think what the most important person(clearly not the smartest) in the world is missing here is that the members of the Church of the Church Administration do not have a problem with ""offering"".  What they have a problem with is what is Big Ed doing with the offering.  For example what is the purpose of the following big ticket purchases:

\-Philippine Arena  
\-South Dakota (Ghosttown)  
\-Johsonville, Connecticut (Ghosttown)   
\-Shoshoni Wyoming (Mushroom farm)  
\-Pacifica, California (Horse Ranch)   
\-Ladybrand, Africa (Land)  
\-Free State, Africa (Land)  
\-Petrusburg, Africa (Land)  


Also note the Airbus (another dead horse), two helicopters and that sweet sweet lavish lifestyle.

Take all the above in addition to plenty of existing churches which are broken down and in disrepair,  some locales rent, some locales share spaces and some locales do not have anything.  So it's really hard keep giving when all these facts are brought to light.  

Yet all you hear are the various ""weekly offerings"" that need funds - never ending collection of funds.

 Also note that a large majority of members are for lack of a better word poor.  


<Insert signature Eduardo V. Manalo end of sermon spiel here (Hold on to your faith / Value your membership)>  


So that pretty much sums up this end of year shitshow.    


What a waste of 3 hours; but if there's any consolation, it's knowing that I, an ""offended"" am living rent free in the most important person in the world's head.

One thing I did notice though is that while they still played the video, the choir actually stood up during the intro instead of sitting down the entire song. Weirdly though, they stand up near the end of the intro instead of as soon as the intro starts. I want to talk about the lineup though because I feel like 317 should've been here because of their mention of prophecy and WW1. Also apparently the start of a sucky cult is more important than a freaking world war. Also, all the songs are new and I want to talk about this because honestly now TGs don't feel exciting to me anymore. They used to be the only times where a new hymn gets sung but now that there are only 3 hymns per lineup, uses older songs, and newer songs are sung in regular services, TGs have now become just inflated WSs. I know that WSs are more than just the songs but to me it's the only part that matters considering how the lessons will always be garbage.

As usual with my PPV write-ups, I had too much fun writing this. I formatted (or tried to format) my write-up so that anything in parentheses and/or italics can be skipped over and the overall meaning would remain.

**Overview**

* Topic: obedience to God's word *(what a surprise...)*
* Deadly Themes:
   * Don't Leave the INC (interspersed throughout the sermon)
   * Intensive Propagation (brief mention)
   * The Administration (mentioned near the end)

**Verses**

* Ps 29:11 Amplified; Unlocked Dynamic Bible
* Rom 8:28
* 1 John 5:3 (mentioned only)
* Is 30:18
* Rom 12:12 Last Days Bible; UDB
* Gal 6:9
* Col 1:10 Amp.
   * Intensive Propagation mentioned
* Ps 62:5 Contemporary English; UDB; Living Bible
* Is 48:18 Expanded; UDB
* Is 54:10
* Rom 15:13
   * The Administration mentioned *(more specifically, this verse supposedly outlines their ""prayers"")*

**Prayers & Approx. Breakdowns**

* Officers' Opening Prayer - 4:50
   * Time spent praying to Christ - :32 (11.0%)
   * Time spent praying for Manalo/his helpers/his family/etc. - 1:11 (24.5%)
* Opening Prayer - 4:06
   * Christ - :19 (7.7%)
   * Manalo - :20 (8.1%)
   * *(Close but no cigar...)*
* Closing Prayer - 8:51
   * Christ - :30 (5.6%)
   * Manalo - 1:25 (16.0%)
   * *(I know it's not as long as some previous closing prayers lasted, but whose idea was it to lead a closing prayer more than 2x as long as the opening prayer? Are these ministers secretly having some sort of contest?)*
* Officers' Closing Prayer - 2:15
   * Christ - :19 (14.1%)
   * Manalo - :27 (20%)
* Total - 20:02
   * Christ - 1:40 (8.3%)
   * Manalo - 3:23 (16.9% ‚Äî *Surprise! /s More than 2x as much as Christ!*)

**Just for Fun!/Other Metrics & Observations**

* Tuloy Tally/Continue Count - 31 *(I* ***swear*** *during the reading of Col 1:10, the reader himself also said it in the Tagalog/Filipino streaming. If that's true and my tally is correct, the number could be 32)*
   * *(Hmm, seems much lower than in previous PPVs, possibly because I heard EVM say, ""Ulit!"" \[""Again!""\] at least 10 or 12 times)*
   * *(6 of these ""Tuloys!"" occurred during the reading of Col 1:10 \[7 if the reader himself saying it counts\])*
* Sermon Length - 55m
   * *NOTE: Does not include the text cards displayed before the before text hymn.*
* Total PPV Length: 1h34m *(or about 1:33:59 longer than I would've hoped!)*
* Tuloy Density - 1 per 1:46 (if 31), 1 per 1:43 (if 32)
* *(At one point in the sermon, the reader sounded like he was saying, ""Gunter Gleiben Glauchen Globen,"" from the beginning of Def Leppard's ""Rock of Ages."")*
* *(I'm sure the administration's true prayers are: ""Father...please keep...everyone trapped in this place...make them give us all their money...and all their time...so we may become rich, O Father..."" \[10 minutes later\] ""O Father...please bless...above all...our dear beloved leader..."" \[you already know how this part goes, so I won't go any further...\])*
* *(Apparently \[per EVM\] being inactive in the INC is somehow worse than having COVID.)*

And then it's church administrator this and brother Eduardo V. Manalo that. And their words are god's words bullshit again. The administration and EVM got mentioned more than Jesus on this lesson.

People leave INC because they know better than to believe anything the Manalo says. They do their own research!

ANG DAHILAN KUNG BAKIT ANUMAN ANG GAWIN NG TAO RITO SA MUNDO AY WALA RING KASIYAHAN

Itinuturing ng marami na kapag naging marunong, tanyag, at mayaman ang tao ay magagawa na niya ang mga bagay na makapagdudulot ng ganap na kasiyahan. Sa mensaheng ito, na batay sa leksiyong inihanay ni Kapatid na Era√±o Manalo mula sa mga katotohanang nakasulat sa Biblia noong siya ay nabubuhay pa, ay patutunayan sa atin na anuman ang gawin ng tao rito sa mundo ay wala ring kasiyahan.

Ayon sa Eclesiastes 2:10-11 at 22-23, ang tinatamo ng tao sa lahat niyang gawa sa ilalim ng araw ay mga kapanglawan lamang. Ito ay pinatotohanan ni Haring Solomon nang sinabi niyang, ""Ang lahat ng ... aking pinagsikapang gawin ... ay walang kabuluhan at nauuwi sa wala, at walang pakinabang sa ilalim ng araw.""

Si Haring Solomon ay naging pinakamayamang hari sa Israel at naging makapangyarihan. Maraming dakila at magagandang bagay ang kaniyang nagawa, tulad ng palasyo na kaniyang tahanan. Subalit ayon sa kaniya, ang lahat ng kaniyang ginawa at natamo ay walang kabuluhan. At kahit naging tanyag siya dahil sa kaniyang karunungan, ipinahayag niya sa Eclesiastes 2:15 na, ""Kung ano ang nangyari sa mangmang gayon ang mangyayari sa akin."" Kaya, nasabi niyang wala ring kabuluhan ang kaniyang pagiging pantas o pagiging marunong.

Kahit ang tao ay maging mayaman, hindi pa rin siya magtatamo ng ganap na kasiyahan. Ang sabi ni Haring Solomon sa Eclesiastes 5:10, ""Siyang umiibig sa pilak ay hindi masisiyahan sa pilak ... ito man ay walang kabuluhan."" Kaya, anuman ang natamo ng tao, maging ito'y karunungan, katanyagan, at kayamanan, at anuman ang nagawa niya, ay hindi rin magdudulot sa kaniya ng ganap na kasiyahan. Ito'y sapagkat, ayon sa Eclesiastes 4:1-3, hindi pa rin nawawala ang kapighatian. Dahil sa napatunayang ito ni Haring Solomon, pinuri niya ang patay nang higit kaysa sa may buhay, at sinabi niyang mas maigi pa kaysa sa kanila kapuwa ang hindi ipinanganak sapagkat hindi ito nakakita ng masamang gawa o hindi naranasan ang kapighatian. 

Talagang hindi malalasap ng tao ang ganap na kasiyahan sa buhay sa mundong ito. Kaya, batay sa Awit 102:25-26, itinakda ng Diyos na papalitan ang lupa at mga gawang narito, maging ang langit at mga gawang naroon. Ang dahilan nito, ayon sa Roma 8:20-21, ay naalipin ng kabulukan ang buong nilalang. Naging walang kabuluhan ito at sinumpa. 

Nagsimula ang sumpa ng Diyos sa daigdig, alinsunod sa Genesis 3:17 at 19, nang ang mga unang tao na sina Adan, at Eva ay nagkasala dahil sa paglabag sa utos ng Diyos. Dahil dito, sinumpa ang lupa at tinakdaan ng Diyos ng kamatayan ang tao. Noong hindi pa sila nagkakasala, ang mga tao'y nasa magandang kalagayan sa halamanan ng Eden, batay sa Genesis 2:7-9. Ngunit nang sumpain sila ng Diyos dahil sa kanilang kasalanan, ang sabi sa Job 14:1-2, ""Taong ipinanganak ng babae ay sa kaunting araw, at lipos ng kabagabagan."" Pagkatapos ng paglalang kay Adan at kay Eva, lahat ng tao ay ipinanganak na ng babae. At totoong ang buhay ng lahat ng tao ay maikli, may kabagabagan, at may kamatayan. 

Tanging sa kamatayang pagkalagot ng hininga, itinakda rin ng Diyos sa tao ang ikalawang kamatayan, batay sa Apocalipsis 20:14. Ito ay ang kamatayan sa dagat-dagatang apoy na siyang ganap na kabayaran ng kasalanan. Dapat sikapin ng tao na hanapin ang lunas sa mga suliraning ito. 

Ang tanging lunas sa kasawiang sinapit ng sangkatauhan ay ang bagong lupa, at langit na nilikha ng Diyos, ayon sa Isaias 65:17-19. Iyon ang ipapalit ng Diyos sa mundo. Doon, ang tao ay matutuwa at magagalak magpakailan man. Tinitiyak din sa Apocalipsis 21:4 na wala na roong kamatayan, dalamhati, panambitan, o hirap, sapagkat lahat ng bagay na nagdudulot ng mga ito ay naparam na. Samakatuwid, ang mga magmamana ng bagong lupa at langit o ng Bayang Banal ang siyang tiyak na magtatamo ng ganap na kasiyahan. Inaasahan naman ng Diyos, alinsunod sa Isaias 65:23, na sila'y ""hindi gagawa ng walang kabuluhan ... sapagkat sila ang lahi ng mga pinagpala ng Panginoon.""

Pinatutunayan sa Mateo 19:28 na ang lahi ng mga pinagpala ay ang mga sumusunod sa Panginoong Jesucristo sa pagbabagong-lahi. 

Ayon sa Efeso 2:15 at Colosas 1:18, sila ay ang mga kasama sa isang taong bago na nilalang Niya mula sa dalawa: si Cristo na ulo, at ang Iglesia na katawan‚Äîisang taong bago sa kabuuan. Ang tinutukoy ng mga apostol na Iglesia ay ang Iglesia Ni Cristo. Kung gayon, ang Iglesia Ni Cristo ang kaparaanan upang makarating ang tao sa bagong lupa at langit o sa Bayang Banal na siyang tanging lunas sa kasawiang nararanasan ng sangkatauhan. Napakapalad natin dahil kaanib tayo sa Iglesia Ni Cristo.

Huwag natin ipagpapalit sa anuman at kaninuman ang ating pagka-Iglesia Ni Cristo kahit pa makaranas tayo ng pag-uusig. Kapag inuusig tayo, alalahanin natin ang pahayag ng Panginoong Jesucristo sa Juan 15:20-21 na, ""Ang alipin ay hindi dakila kay sa kaniyang panginoon."" Kung Ako'y kanilang pinag-uusig, kayo man ay kanilang pinag-uusig din."" Sinabi pa Niya na, ""Ang lahat ng mga bagay na ito ay gagawin nila sa inyo dahil sa Aking Pangalan."" Ito ang pangalang itinatawag sa atin‚ÄîIglesia Ni Cristo. Gayunman, tinitiyak Niya sa Mateo 5:10-12 na, ""Mapapalad ang mga pinag-uusig dahil sa katuwiran sapagkat kanila ang kaharian ng langit."" Kung gayon, hindi kalugihan kung makaranas tayo ng pag-uusig o pagwikaan tayo ng masama na pawang kasinungalingan at alimurahin dahil sa pagka-Iglesia Ni Cristo. Kaya ang sabi Niya, ""Mangagalak kayo, at mangagsayang totoo: sapagkat malaki ang ganti sa inyo sa langit."" 

Anuman ang nagawa at natamo natin dito sa mundo ay mawawalan ng kabuluhan at hindi magdudulot sa atin ng ganap na kaligayahan sapagkat dito ay makakaranas pa rin tayo ng kapighatian. **Ang ating pagka-Iglesia Ni Cristo ang tanging magdudulot sa atin ng ganap na kaligayahan** sapagkat sa pamamagitan ay makakaasa tayo na makapapasok sa Bayang Banal. Kaya mahalin natin at lubos na pahalagahan ang ating pagka-Iglesia Ni Cristo.

Oh we‚Äôve heard the obey and submit to the administration lesson so many times, but this is the absolute worst obey admin/lord EVM lesson to date.    They are not just doubling down, they are freaking tripling down on the admin/EVM obedience.  

This PPV is a huge middle finger to all physically in, mentally out trapped members in the cult because one of the focal points of this lesson is to attack and character assassinate people who use social media or what they call ‚Äúgodless chatter‚Äù.  Over and over they shit on people who dare use their critical thinking skills.  They literally use the word cult, and shit on people who call INC a cult.  I‚Äôm not even joking, the officiating minister called people who go on social media who go against the church as virtue signalers.  They even called it a sickness, they actually called it cancer.

1. Absolute authoritarianism without meaningful accountability.
2. No tolerance for questions or critical inquiry.
3. No meaningful financial disclosure regarding budget, expenses such as an independently audited financial statement.
4. Unreasonable fear about the outside world, such as impending catastrophe, evil conspiracies and persecutions.
5. There is no legitimate reason to leave, former followers are always wrong in leaving, negative or even evil.
6. Former members often relate the same stories of abuse and reflect a similar pattern of grievances.
7. There are records, books, news articles, or television programs that document the abuses of the group/leader.
8. Followers feel they can never be ""good enough"".
9. The group/leader is always right.
10. The group/leader is the exclusive means of knowing ""truth"" or receiving validation, no other process of discovery is really acceptable or credible.

**Some Observations**

* The sermon itself was about 41 minutes.
* The closing prayer lasted nearly 6 minutes.
   * During the time the minister was (supposedly) praying to Christ, he couldn't help but start praying for the dEaReSt ElDeR (or however it was worded).
* The last officers' prayer lasted roughly a minute and 30-40 seconds.
* I failed to time the other prayers.
* From the start of the first hymn (not counting officers' prayer hymn) to the end of the recessional hymn was about an hour and 10-ish minutes.
* I just love how the minister on the video tried to turn the tables by claiming other religions are cults and not the INC. So basically: ""I know you are, but what am I?"" apparently forgetting everything that just came out of his mouth.
* Just to get to the sermon took 22 minutes after the (supposed) start time. Not only did the hymns start late by about 5 minutes, but the hymns themselves moved at a glacial pace (looking at you, whoever played hymn 191!). 367 lasted nearly 3 minutes; [356](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puLIRjumVbw) and the aforementioned 191 lasted about 4 apiece.
   * How do I know this? They have a cheat-sheet that tells when each hymn starts and dictates which hymn is the last before opening prayer.
   * For whatever reason, the prelude section is much longer now; previously, it was only about 23-25 minutes to accommodate the officers' opening prayer; now, it's about 29-30 minutes. Unless the officer playing the file skips to the start of hymn-singing at the WS start time, the hymns will start late (esp. if the person praying takes his/her time) ; unfortunately, whoever made the video file felt like leaving all the preludes in, and my preacher didn't feel the need to start the hymns on time (or probably couldn't figure out how), so with these combined with the lengthy officers' prayer, the delay was very noticeable.
* Apparently these video worthless services are vErY sEcUrE to the point that the preacher guy must delete the file with the TSV witnessing (or vice versa, may even include other officers in either scenario). Aww, that's so considerate! They're taking the oUtSiDeRs into consideration by not letting this drivel get anywhere near them! /s
   * oh who am I kidding...they don't want to give OuTsIdErS the satisfaction that their thoughts about this cult are correct.

he was talking about how the LGBTQ+ community wants to be accepted and to be treated with respect but being gay is a sin so basically it shouldnt be granted. what the fuck is that? first off, the bible doesnt even say that homosexuality is a sin. there was a mistranslation and for the past 50 yrs people just rolled with it. second, even if it was a sin, can‚Äôt you be a decent fucking human being and respect everyone regardless of who they love? why does the inc genuinely believe that god is gonna make them rot in hell if those of the same sex love each other? i swear to god the inc preaches shit as if we‚Äôre still in the 1700‚Äôs or something. they think being gay is equivalent to being a murderer.

Sex and gender are two different things.

""We don't promote hatred bla bla, HOWEVER,... ""  If you would say something like this, please just shut up.

Even pronouns were discussed in this sermon. They were not invented by the lgbtq community lmao

I don't believe in God anymore, so please, I don't care if you all go to heaven and we lgbtq go to hell. We're gonna party there. Y'all be happy without sadness and tears like robots for eternity in heaven idgaf

I wish I were brave enough to fly the lgbtq flag at the choir loft during the sermon lol but I don't wanna get shot and killed. If anyone is brave enough, this would be an excitingly scandalous thing to do.

   * Christ - :11 (11.1%)
   * Manalo - ???
   * All I know is that the part for Manalo and all his helpers and whoever started about 28 seconds before the end of the prayer, so his section can't be longer than that.

* Total - 14:27
   * Christ - 1:34
   * If whoever did the final officers' prayer stopped praying for EVM 9 seconds before ending the prayer, then the two ""scores"" would be even at 94 seconds. If the minister praying went any closer, then Manalo would have won...if any of what I just typed even makes sense at this point. I'm just surprised the two scores are actually close to each other.

1. Sino ba ang mga pinatatamaang influencers? Masyadong broad ang lesson para maunawaan kung ano/sino ang tinutukoy

2. Dont forget to like, share and subscribe ba? Ah gets ko na? Upon seeing the data in FB inc media page, mas marami pa nga naman ang shares and likes ng mga influencers kesa FB page ng mga InCult media pages, gusto din ata mag trending haha. Mas gugustuhin ko na lang din magshare ng mga good deeds ng mga influencers kesa mag share ng inc content...

2. Rgarding naman sa usaping moral, since ang target bracket ay age 13-19 (i guess?) na sinabi sa teksto SINCE NA ITO AY USAPING MORAL siguro pwede nyo nang ibalato yan sa mga values education teachers/subjects/Magulang nila? kase usaping moral naman yan at mag focus na lang ang inc sa spiritual tutal ang good deeds lang naman sa inc ay maghandog at mag misyon BIHIRA naman ako makarinig sa mga teksto na maging mabuti sa kapwa.

3. Teachers are also influencers, kapag sinabi ko sa klase ko na ang OPISYAL NA SIMULA NG WW1 ay July 28, 1914 at may mga proofs ako na yun ang simula... so cancel na ba natin si sir/mam kase taliwas sa sinasabi ng PamAMaHaLa? Haha... 

4.

**My Comments/Observations**

* Even though the minister claims God should be a believer's influencer, it's clear he means EVM should be.
* Yet again, the minister encourages parents to monitor their children and condition them into accepting and remaining in their INC duty/ies. Hmm...just last week, did the minister that week not insist, ""We'Re NoT a CuLt""?

**Stray Thoughts/Just for Fun!**

* How in the heck can 9 cherry-picked selections of the Bible require this much explanation?
   * I assume fast preachers do not exist in the higher ranks of the INC ministry (if it can even be called that). Or they do, but they either drag out the sermon for appearance's sake or simply are never chosen for video services.
   * I guess Central has a bunch of defective, oversized record players, considering all these ministers that seem to enjoy imitating broken records.
* I thought February was supposed to be the shortest month, yet all these mock-PPVs are making it drag...
* I didn't time anything this go-around. Except...
* At least the hymns started a little early this time as opposed to 3-5 minutes late (Anything to get me outta there even slightly quicker!).
* Don't you just love four-minute ""hymns"" (402)? Did that hymn really need FOUR stanzas?
* Whose idea was it to write a unison part that goes up to F5 (F4 for tenor/bass) in 442? Whoever you are, you do realize there are these people called ‚Äúaltos‚Äù and ‚Äúbasses,‚Äù right?

"Mid-week Worship Service Examination (Feb 08 - Feb 10, 2022)",snm8t5,2022-02-08,"Re-watching this lesson and am laughing that they used these verses:

**Psalm 139:13,16** 

>You created every part of me; you put me together in my mother's womb. You saw me before I was born. The days allotted to me had all been recorded in your book, before any of them ever began.

AND his explanation--verbatim--was:

>*Why will those who listen to the lord god, who allow the lord god to be the influencer in their lives, why are they certain to receive blessings and victories continuously in their life?*   
  
>  
>*Because, based on what we read, this servant of the lord god said, ""You created every part of me."" And not only are we ALL creations of our lord god.* ***Based on what we read, the lord god already knows the life span of each one of us. And because the lord god already knows each one of us, created each one of us****. We should* ***remember, brethren, that he controls every aspect of our life. He knows everything about us. And that includes even those people we admire.***   
  
>  
>*Those internet personalities. Commonly branded as ""influencers""!* ***The lord god created them! The lord god knows their lifespan as well!*** *And because of that, who knows more? What is good for us? Who can assure us of victories, of blessings, of good things? Not these influencers. Not these internet personalities. Rather, what they know--let's remember this--what they know can never surpass the knowledge of the lord god who created us.*

So all of us, including them, ALL of us should listen to what the lord god teaches. All of us should accept as our influencer, the lord god who created us.

Of course--with BITE method--people are still being controlled as to what Information and Thoughts they should have with how he read it and explained it. Anyone should just ask the ONE question that is still left on the table after hearing this verse and explanation: If god TRULY created us and knows every detail of our lives, why do I have to join or attend WS?

Really, what IS the point of inviting people if God--supposedly--already KNOWS who is his, who is going to join, and WHEN they will join? If god controls EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES, he knows we are reading this Subreddit because he made this happen. If he knows all these things, no one needs to invite like crazy, right? No one should be punished for not inviting or for not bearing ""fruit"", right?

Furthermore, as his explanation unraveled and said: *""The lord god created them! The lord god knows their lifespan as well.""* Should not the same rules apply? Which runs completely counter to their lesson where they bashed the LGBT community and that *""No one is born that way."" ""They turned away from God with their sinful ways of life.""* **BS** These verses and this explanation from their minister says, *""God created them. God knows and controls every aspect of their life too.""* Ergo, God made them LGBTQ+. Just like he made me straight. Just like he made influencers who are influencing their children to question their blind faith.

If you are an INC member, here are some other verses that should tell you that ""intensive propagation"" is not needed because God ""already knows who is his"" and is the one placing people. Don't be blinded when the ministers say *""well, you are the instrument who brought them into the church.""* no, no, no... According to these verses, God knows and pre-destined everyone and everything. He does the work, who can hinder it? 

* 1 Corinthians 12:18, 
* Proverbs 16:4, 
* Acts 4:28, 
* Revelation 17:17, 
* Psalm 94:11, 
* Jeremiah 29:11, 
* Isaiah 43:13,
*  Isaiah 14:27, 
* 1 Thessalonians 5:23, 24, 
* Romans 8:28-32, 
* Romans 11:1-36, 
* Jeremiah 1:5, 2 
* Timothy 2:19

Another verse that stuck with me was: 

**Ecclesiastes 9:11** 

>I realized another thing, that in this world fast runners do not always win the races, and the brave do not always win the battles. The wise do not always earn a living, intelligent people do not always get rich, and capable people do not always rise to high positions. **Bad luck happens to everyone**.

""Bad luck"" happens? Really? We shouldn't trust in someone who is strong, brave, wise, capable, or intelligent because ""bad luck"" happens to ALL people and they may experience it too? Are we NOT talking about the bible and God anymore? Luck is the phenomenon and belief that defines the experience of notably positive, negative, or improbable events. It's CHANCE!

Going back to the verse mentioned earlier, God already knows whats going to happen and luck--being a superstitious belief--should NOT be used as a basis for one's faith.

Here's my ""spritually immature fit"" as per INC.

They tell us to bring our concerns to the church administration. I already know how this will go. I go to them and ask questions, they ostracize me then try to answer my question. And if they couldn't find an answer, they character assassinate me maybe even expel me and tell everyone to shun me like how EVM did to his mother and brother. So no, I'd rather ""throw a fit"" here where I'm free to speak my thoughts freely and anonymously. What they said there is obviously a trap and I know better than to fall for it.

INC says ""We don't blindly obey"", proceeds to promote blind obedience.

INC again denies being a cult and a bigot. But then shows that they are a cult and a bigot.

A few things:

""Do not seek answers in social media"".  Umm, members went to social media because the INCult refused to provide transparency on a whole host of events that started in 2015. Members were curious and needed information on rumors and news which turned out to be true. Instead of providing a response, the INCult doubled down and immediately had a service commanding that members ""just obey"".   Needless to say the current climate in social media related to the INCult is due to the INCult itself.

""If you have any questions, bring it to the church administration."" Recall former minister Lowell Menorca, who was being harrassed due the administration's suspicion of him being AE.  Lowell Menorca himself went to the church administration (EVM) for help.  So what exactly happened when he approached the church administration?

Then there's this part where they told us to consider having an office a blessing (as an officer myself, I can tell you that it's not). They tell us use as much of our time as possible for the church. Does that not sound like exploitation to you?

And like the cult they are, they start preaching about doomsday again where they create imaginary problems and sell imaginary solutions that you need to work and pay for in real life.

Then comes their play the victim part where they say the world hates them.

His prayers sounded desperate too, come on really? Praying to God to make us go away? 

INC is against being WOKE, they hate the idea of us being self aware and being aware of the issues around us cause they know they won't be able to exploit us for profit.

They see people as nothing more than drones or pets they can just leash and control. That analogy part where he talked about someone walking off a cliff to his death when unguided really made me think of that, that part was just stupid.

Also, INC preached that they see men and women as equal but then when it came to the announcements they said that SFM is only for men (stated as one of the requirements).

First off, they never mentioned what exactly 'woke' means.

ANYWAY. i hate how fervently against they are critical thinking ... and social media in general

'Dont like, share or even subscribe to their ideas -- because thats *no* easy sin!'

?????????? okay? talk abt fear mongering jfccc GBWEAHHAHAHA

Anyway, the gist is that the only way you can ever be right / morally correct is through the bible. But not even through that simple manner ?? 

You need to submit yourself to the church administration if you ever dare to be right, and let them take a hold of you, your humanity and your entire ideology which i find STUPID. 

They say it like 'woke people' (or. yknow, people who are fighting for EQUAL HUMAN RIGHTS) are just stupid opinionated mfs who hate anyone who isnt like them. Which. Is so backwards ...?

They also seem to brainwash church goers with the threat of the digital age, making them reject modernity and preserve the traditional-leaning perspectives in the bible! 

I mean, obviously, social media platforms are spaces for discourses and not all expressions we see online are facts. That‚Äôs why posts and credible sources are peer-reviewed. 

However, with the words they preach, I beg to question what exactly are their grounds for them to mock ‚Äúunmentioned‚Äù contents as unreliable? They couldn‚Äôt even give an example of the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù talks they‚Äôre referring to!

About the hymns, 489 is energy filled fun. 354 is whatever. 510 is amazing but the lyrics kinda affect my opinion on it for being that bad. 429 has the only lyric out of all the INC hymns that I liked (but only out of context and in tagalog though). Hearing that lyric for the first time hit like a truck but hearing it a billion times due to this hymn's frequency makes me feel nothing for it. 423 drags on for too long which is weird to say for a before text hymn.

* EVM never mentioned a single translation.

**Deadly Themes**

* Don't Leave the INC
* I'm not sure if these count, but the following were mentioned briefly:
   * Detractors
   * Social Media against the Church
   * The Administration

**Stray Observations/Thoughts**

* Tuloy Tally/Continue Count: 52
   * Last time only had 32; is EVM trying to make up for it? Does he have some yearly quota to meet?
* Sermon: 54 minutes
* Total PPV: 1 hour, 35 minutes
* After the reading of Eph. 6:12-13, EVM goes on a tangent, claiming INC remains standing in spite of the Japanese Army during WWII, ministers in key positions who rebelled against the admin (while providing a shoutout to social media yet not citing examples), and Martial Law. I wonder if it will remain standing in spite of a pandemic or a certain social media platform (whose name will never be uttered by a minister or worker for obvious reasons) further garnering attention.
* During his ending mock-prayer, EVM says, ""We will love our membership in the Church of Christ,"" in an attempt to keep believers brainwashed.
* I still wish the reader would throw a bible at or near EVM considering how often the interruptions occur.
* Oops! EVM forgot to mention offerings in his homily. And offerings drop to an all-time low..

**Hymns**

So just take last Sunday's lineup, replace 510 with 514, replace 429 with the two processionals (""All Our Praise to You"" & ""Lord God, Do Not Abandon Us""), and there's today's lineup.

* 135 (""I Draw Near to You"")
   * mentions one's INC membership: ""Thank You for calling me to Your fold""
* 489 (""People of God, Give Him Glory"")
   * the slogan from late 2019 the admin churned out
   * lecture showtune
   * If INC believes God (or Jesus, as seen above) calls people into the fold, then why do the lyrics go: ""There is no doubt whatsoever/There is surely no mistake/In deciding to join this church/Where we steadfastly remain""?
      * If ""There is surely no mistake,"" then why do so many people disagree?
      * If ""We steadfastly remain,"" why all the expulsions (key ministers especially, as seen above)?
* 354 (""Truly Blessed Are Those Who Are Obedient"")
   * ...
* 514 (""Do Not Be Anxious over Anything"")
   * Wow! Just like that, anxiety levels drop 100% among people trapped in a cult! /s
   * lecture hymn
   * If the title is true, then why are ministers and workers so anxious over the littlest things? Or am I just stuck in an unlucky region?
* The second processional hymn mentions cherishing and defending one's calling; apparently that's more important than two spiritual beings these days...
* 423 (""Submit to the Father's Will"")
   * They misspelled ""Manalo's Will""

* i tried *really* hard not to laugh when eddy boi mentioned that the Catholics endorsed a president and implied that INC is above all of that. something pot something kettle.
* i *hate* at the end of every lesson they do this fake prayer thing, where they say that we all pray for safety and guidance and what not. dude if you're going to pray just fucking pray. don't spend 15 minutes saying what you should be praying for.
* they mentioned social media again. can you just say ""reddit"" already and put us all out of our misery, thanks

The lesson isn't the worst as well. Good things will happen if you believe in God. I don't recall any notable bad things about this lesson though it's probably because I was barely awake during the entire thing. It's not bad but it's still an INC lesson and it's still a PPV so it's still mega sleep-inducing. Literally the only reason why I didn't fall asleep completely was because my dad was next to me. Now about the lineup:

489, 354, 423: Utter disappointments why the hell did they just repeat the lineup from last Sunday? 489 is still really fun though.

514: Interesting. This is probably going to be sung in the Holy Suffer 2022 but I guess it makes its debut in this PPV. It's pretty good but I feel like it will grow on me after quite some time. I love the peacefulness of the chorus. The lyrics have some anti-doubting and feel way too controlling of your emotions. Like it's literally titled ""Do Not Be Anxious over Anything"".

Processional 1 is pretty fun but Processional 2 sucks ass. It feels like a faster officer hymn.

I'd rate this a 5/10. It's slightly better than the regular worship service but it's definitely one of the more sleep-inducing ones.

**Hymns**
* Officers‚Äô prayer hymn 235 includes an obligatory lyric about the church: ‚Äú‚Ä¶I still remain inside Your dear Church‚Ä¶‚Äù (yes, they would capitalize that)
* Hymn 124 includes a refrain about loving and defending the church (even in the pre-2012 edition).

* Of course 424, the (in)famous ‚ÄúAs For Me And (All) My Family‚Äù, plays ([YouTube link](https://youtu.be/7E_V-WzrFkU)). It has 2 stanzas that mention a member‚Äôs calling into the fold/church and a refrain that mentions treasuring the election s/he and his/her family received.

**Hymns**

As u/formerlyfaithful mentioned, the hymns this PPV are repeated from [last weekend](https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/t6ktuj/weekend_worship_service_examination_mar_04_mar_07/hzjkqgn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3), with three exceptions:

* 515 instead of 54
   * lecture/obedience hymn, includes a church namedrop in the refrain ([lyrics below](https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/tbry3m/comment/i0e68cp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))
* 516 instead of [424 (""As for Me and My Family"")](https://youtu.be/7E_V-WzrFkU)
   * submission/obedience ([lyrics below](https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/tbry3m/comment/i0e68cp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))
* 387 (""His Teachings Are the Light"") instead of 80
   * lecture hymn

Same preludes as [last PPV](https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/t1609n/comment/hyjdhlt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), with an interlude of 211 (""Father, We Thank You So Much""). Hymn 6 (""My Salvation Rests in My Duty"") plays in the background during the ordination excerpt.

**Prayer Times**

For those who don't yet know, ministers don't seem to spend much time praying to or even for Christ, despite being part of the Church of Christ. Although I didn't time the final officers' prayer, I did time the rest. My findings:

* Officers' opening prayer - 4 minutes, 57 seconds
   * Christ gets 33 seconds, or about 11.1% of the prayer.
* Opening prayer - 5:57
   * Christ - :15  (4.2%)
* Post-lesson prayer - 8:27
   * Christ - :32 (6.3%)
* Post-ordination prayer - 4:13
   * Christ - :14 (5.5%)
* Assuming the final officers' prayer lasted roughly the average of 2 minutes, this would put the total praying time at around 26 minutes. Unless Christ got at least 26 seconds in the final officers' prayer, he didn't even get 2 minutes over all 5 prayers.

**Other Metrics**

* Total PPV - 1h34m36s
* Sermon - 51m33s
* Pakinggan Niyo/Listen Count - 15+ (I was dozing off, so I may have missed a few.)
* Tuloy Tally/Continue Count - 31+",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/tbry3m/weekend_worship_service_examination_mar_11_mar_14/

143: solid.

515: might grow on me but so far I don't like it.

516: good but it might grow on me like 514 did (also it doesn't have as embarrassingly awful lyrics like 514 does).

Takeaways on F2F Worship Service:
- Since we have now loosened restrictions, it's about time for the brethren to return to the temple for worship services.
- If one is not excited on returning to F2F worship services on the temple, he has a weak faith. Ok?
- PPS / Household worship services are now and as much as possible applicable for selected fellows -- PWDs or senior citizens.
- Anything that is approved by the Administration has guidance from our Lord God. So during the pandemic, HWS has blessings from God since it was a command by the administration. but now since our holy administration told us to go back to the temple for worship services, the minister implied (emphasis on implied) that HWS is not being graced by God anymore. üòí",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/tepnei/midweek_worship_service_examination_mar_15_mar_17/

The lesson goes over four points about what they say separates the Religion of God and the Religion of man.

1. Religion of man act as if they were God‚Äôs nation that does what is right.  
2. True religion obeys the commandment of God.  Religion of man acts as if they have not turned away from God‚Äôs command.  In truth they are no longer following God‚Äôs teachings 
3. True religion purpose is to please God.  Religion of man is out of convenience, it‚Äôs about what they like, not what God likes.
4. People following the Religion of man feel that their service is not being accepted.

After talking about those four points, lesson then take about ‚Äúsubstance‚Äù of the religion of God vs the religion of Man.  Instead of submitting to God‚Äôs way, people following religion of Man established their own way.  They created their own system of religion. In their actions it can be seen that they are not practicing the true religion because it‚Äôs not the teachings of god and his commandments they are following.  When you look at the substance, when you look at their deeds, they are not following the commandments of God.

Our minister preaching actually said this:

Look at the teachings of the Iglesia ni Cristo, 
If you can find even one teaching or doctrine or practice that we do here inside this church that is not substantiated by what's written in the Bible, then this is not the true church.  

When examined closely, everything about this church, its teachings and practices, and you will find it's all based upon the teachings of God written in the holy scriptures.""

So they didn't further elaborate as to what made INC different and true compared to other other religions aside from us attending WS (which other churches do too), giving ""voluntary"" offerings (which other churches do too), and following the CA (which other churches do too with their own church leaders). So they basically just said that INC is the true church because...it just is according to the bible. No cringey July 27 1914 Manalo prophecy via the warped Isaiah interpretation nor Acts 20:28 Lamsa mentioned (I'm glad they didn't).

Minister also preached that one will be successful in life if one obeys God's commands (usually meaning the CA's demands).

How exactly would one be successful in life just by devoting almost all of his/her time to the church and complying with the CA's demands? Would money, food and property just magically appear for him/her to enjoy? Would the church pay them for their time in cash instead of prayers? No, I don't think so.

**Don't leave the INC**  \- **This is not up to the Administration,** but up to the individual if the INC does not teach the real truth from the Bible!!!

**Other religions are wrong** \- Compared to the INC, most religions are much more inline with God's will then them.

**Offerings** \- They are what you can comfortably afford and the original name is considered a **""tithe""** and **it is in the Bible,** being about **10%** and NO more...

**Detractors** \- Those are the **ministers of the INC!**

**Social Media against the Church** \- all is good, to make you a better ""critical thinker...""

**The Administration** \- They mainly preach lies and **should not be trusted!!!**

**Observations**
* usual start of calamities, trials, etc.
   * mention of Russia vs. Ukraine, rising fuel prices, food shortages

* Apparently EVM needs 6 other ministers (excluding the reader) with him (5 if there‚Äôs one head deacon behind the pulpit).

**Prayers**
* Officers' Opening Prayer - 5:20

* Opening Prayer - 4:58
   * Christ - :14 (4.7%)
   * Manalo - :24 (8.1%)
   * Something about this prayer seemed off as, during the time the minister spent praying to Christ, it suddenly went to the ""these things we ask"" part without returning to the Father (unless I just missed what would have had to have been a very quick transition)
* Closing Prayer - 8:29
   * Christ - :33 (6.5%)
   * Manalo - :57 (11.2%)

   * self-explanatory title

* Same preludes as the previous 2 video streamings
* Interlude: 103 (""Have Mercy, LORD, on Me"")

**Just for Fun!**

* Total PPV - 1h27m53s

No shit I know what ""God will be with you"" means. I passed high school language classes for Christ's sake. This lesson could've been 50% shorter if he just got on with his point.

241: Basically 106 if it was a lecture hymn. I kinda like it. 

Processional 1/2: These two sound so similar so minus points for which one came after the other but they do sound cool when they're played back to back because of their similar melody. Also I like these two way more than any other Webex Processionals they've been blasting us with (this is the first and possible only time I'll say the Processional is actually my favorite out of the lineup).

496: I hear the descant. Just barely though. This descant is significantly worse than 470 and 469.

Another thing I want to talk about is audio quality. While it's kind of been a meme that INC Video Streamings have pretty not good quality, this one's weird.

* Not sure if it‚Äôs just my region, but the preacher mentioned detractors and the administration as well.
   * INC will insist that the DeTrAcToRs never found any evidence against the admin, and that no one can ever ruin INC‚Äôs integrity. Are they THAT afraid/arrogant to wave the white flag? Also, how do you ruin something that doesn‚Äôt exist?

1. So the serpent (Satan?) lied by saying Eve will not die, contrary to what God said. Eve did, in fact, not die. So who is lying again?
2. Why is it bad to know good and evil? Ignorance is bliss but shouldn't one know it's bad to kill, or steal, or claim that one is a messenger of God while sexually assaulting women?
3. Wasn't God's plan to have Jesus killed all along? Why are the ones responsible for his death always considered the bad guys? Aren't they just enacting God's plan? God is the mastermind of all of that. 
4.  So, they go back to the claim that there is no corruption and misappropriation because the church is able to continue building houses of worship and conducting outreach programs. How is this even still in the talking points? We already know that the first family has been building and acquiring luxurious properties and has offshore accounts in places where people put their money to keep it away from prying eyes (legal or otherwise). Now if you have $10 in offering and you use $1 of that to build some chapel, the other $9 for some non-church related thing, like, I don't know, maybe a new $9 toupee, who can  tell you that you've misused the money if no one knows how much you had to begin with?

Lesson started with the story of Adam and Eve and how the ""talking snake devil"" is still decieving us to this day.

Minister mentioned ""unity voting"" and he basically said that whoever did not vote for whoever candidate the Executive Minister chooses is a fool. So to him, blind obedience equals wisdom. What a wise guy he is. /s

Minister also claims that we have no proof of EVM's corruption...yeah, he's definitely the type who'll ignores evidences presented to his face.

This is the most irritating lesson (no, it's actually propaganda) that I had to endure. The minister himself is also irritating to listen to especially with his condascending tone. He beats around the bush and then goes off topic here and there making the lesson longer than usual.

He told us that we must be kept busy with church activites (like intensive propagation of course) and offices at all times so that we won't have the time to ""get decieved"". 

Social media against the church was mentioned too.

They care about their reputation so much and that will lead to their downfall. They can‚Äôt not care about it either, because they take pride in that. So either way they‚Äôll continue to sink themselves, at the least their reputation as the ‚Äúone true ‚Äúchurch‚Äù‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm not listening that well because before my body naturally rejected the bullshit they preach and now my ears and mind naturally reject it too, but right now it seems like they‚Äôre teaching about the end signs, which I find kind of interesting.

Hello there, July 27 1914, the supposed start date of WW1. Yep, they proudly claim it and proudly say it‚Äôs the same day of the start of the INCult. They say it so dramatically. Actually, the eyes of the minister are different from how they speak, confident and dramatic about the false date.

Oh hey, they said the verse in that cringy minister cult video, something about ‚Äúthey shall be as nothing‚Äù or something. Probably meant for the ‚Äúdetractors‚Äù. It‚Äôs like they hate people for being smarter or thinking for themselves.

They say we should love one another like brothers/sisters.. seems like the way it‚Äôs done here is like a bunch of childish boastful children trying to one up each other and pushing others down to get ahead by any means

Mention of sharing faith and offerings immediately after, seems to be a package deal shoutout. I wonder why they push so much for participation in ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù offerings.

Yuck, then they said, ‚Äúlet us submit to the church administration‚Äù

All this to prove we are ‚Äútrue disciples of Jesus Christ‚Äù‚Ä¶ right.. show me where it said to obey and submit to a cult that permits assassination, harassment/doxxing, and extortion.


Then they teach about people outside the church are ‚Äúof the world‚Äù, implying a us versus them thing again. So much confidence coming from a cult actively using shady and despicable tactics. Double standards and arrogant confidence.. 

There‚Äôs a verse I remember. ‚ÄúThey are bragging that they are the only ones who will be saved, not knowing that they are from the bad tree.‚Äù


If I were a new guest and I heard them talking this way about outsiders, I would be turned off.

Years in this cult and almost all the strangers I never met before treat me better than they ever could, because most people in the cult are fake, I‚Äôve unfortunately found from experience. Never again am I lending my loyalty and letting my guard down for these people. 


They‚Äôre showing the bible like an ad and saying how good it is, like they made it. Then I look at the other people in the webex meeting and they‚Äôre bored or sleeping. 

‚ÄúNever allow those people to deceive us and separate us from the church of christ‚Äù

I wish they would talk more about Jesus or God, and more about the non fearful-scary side. Something uplifting, original, inspiring, and not recycled. 

I get that it‚Äôs FYM‚Äôs birth month or something, but does *every* worship service have to be about him? 

They mentioned again the ends of the earth thing. It would be a christmas miracle if they ever admit that they got the translation/date wrong. Speaking of, they just got the WW1 start date wrong again, preaching it confidently and boldly. Once you learn of the lie, they appear different.. perhaps because you know 100% for sure that they‚Äôre bullshitting everyone. 

It‚Äôs like someone attempting to defend themselves in court without a lawyer and poor material; everyone knows it‚Äôs BS, they know it‚Äôs BS; it‚Äôs just entertaining to see them desperately plead for themselves knowing that they‚Äôre done either way. 

Still, I wish they would tackle some relevant newer topics that could be useful, rather than old stuff and advertising propaganda and sharing faith every time. At this point I‚Äôm gonna create a format with average times. About 20-30 minutes in, there‚Äôs a mention of ‚Äúworks of propagation‚Äù. There just was, so I can eventually create a checklist/format for what to expect next.

That‚Äôs how predictable and old their teaching style is. Fear mongering gets old and doesn‚Äôt work with the newer generations. There‚Äôs so much change that needs to be done, they need to clean house, and they need to change their styles and approaches. Adapt and get with the times. If they don‚Äôt, they‚Äôre gonna keep damaging their beloved reputation and status. 

My respect for the church has faded to an absolute minimum, and I even refer to it as a cult to people who I talk about it with. They literally said outsiders worship satan/are children of satan. I don‚Äôt know what normal person would join a church that insults them and calls them a devil worshipper. 

They‚Äôre still going on about FYM 30 minutes in. I don‚Äôt think I heard any mention of God or Jesus so far. My foot and leg just went numb and that interested me more. It feels like static in those areas and so weird to move it. Not painful though, just weird. 

It seems like they‚Äôre putting FYM up there with God and Jesus. They can argue that Jesus was a man too, but they‚Äôre talking about him more than God and Jesus. This church was named after Jesus. I wonder what he would think of the current state of the church? 

Cool, they‚Äôre implying that FYM, ministers are the only ones authorized to understand the bible. Apparently they didn‚Äôt get the memo that other people are capable of thought and reading. I think they‚Äôre going to be in denial when they get that memo. 

They‚Äôre saying how they ‚Äústudy many years‚Äù to ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô the bible.. seems like they didn‚Äôt understand enough to include the context. Google exists now to assist with that. 

They really live under a rock don‚Äôt they? They want to remain under that rock where all is under their control. All the while, things outside have evolved and progressed. They should just bite the bullet and acknowledge that things have changed, people are smarter now. They should own up to their mistakes. 

The world isn‚Äôt getting better they say..

Good luck inviting guests when they can easily do some research and see why it‚Äôs more of a cult and can see the controversies. FYM did not prophesize Google and the exposure of the unchristian activities. 

Instead of intensifying the works of propagation, they should intensify renewal of their church while they still can. Clean house, rid the pedophiles and criminals, make things less shitty, understand that people have lives, and don‚Äôt put the church administration up there with God and Jesus.

Ang pagtatamo ng karunungang panlupa ay mahalaga lamang dito sa mundo, pero sa Bayang Banal, mas mahalaga ang mga salita ng Diyos.

Lesson was basically:

- Be ""wise"", it's good for you but don't be too wise. We still need to exploit you. Oh, what we meant to say is, if you let us exploit you, then your wiser than the wise!

Ministers sprinkled a bit of these to help us stay ""wise"":

- Offerings
- Propagation
- The Administration (submit to the admin) 
- Felix Y. Manalo
- World is terrible
- Attend church activities
- Attend WS

Freakin cringey if you ask me. They're trying to control how we use the internet now? All while trying to sound that they have our best interests in mind by telling us to be wise...then distort its meaning in the end.

Seems to be about mainly the youth, and education. Two things that can bring down the INC. They say how some information can deceive us, allow us to be led astray, and I guess that‚Äôs kind of true. Some of the tampered, biased, contextless teachings can make you forget how to be a individual.

- World is terrible
- Doomsday

- INC's ""victories"" 
- Other religions are failing

Absolutely long and absolutely boring. Tried to get the points of his lesson for my checklist while counting his ""tuloys"" to keep me busy. 

I think I heard EVM said at some point that it's ""also for their benefit"" and not just ours if we follow and obey (I think). It kind of made me laugh because it's actually true. It's called exploitation.

And then there's that madatory ""INC is victorious because milestone anniversary"" and ""other religions are crumbling"" bullshit again. 

And of course, the madatory mock prayer in the end to make those who are brainwashed enough cry. I actually looked around to see who's crying.

Didn't close my eyes during their cry praying episodes. Saw like 4 more guys who didn't close their eyes either.

What a special day indeed. Glad to see some sane people there who weren't taking their cry praying playbacks seriously too.

Hymns today basically repeated from [last weekend](https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/uyyuhs/comment/iabjiww/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), except with [443 (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs You, Above All Others, Father Dear, We Will Love Now and Forevermore‚Äù)](https://youtu.be/oO0z0UumuPQ) instead of 485, 62 (""My Duty Divine"") instead of 462, and of course no ""I Am a Member"". I discussed 443 [here (5th paragraph)](https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/nor1jq/comment/h01oo14/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Unlike the rest of the PPV lineup, 62 had previously gone many years before resurfacing (as a rewritten composition). As the title implies, the hymn guilt trips remaining believers into keeping their duty/ies: *""Oh, my consolation in this life is fulfilling my duty,""* begins the refrain.

I know I said in the [midweek discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/v1qxqq/comment/iay9x95/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that I would consider focusing more on INC's arguments, commentary, and hand-picked verses, but the limited notes I did manage to take only rehash the same ones from many if not all of my previous PPV write-ups.",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/v401mp/weekend_worship_service_examination_jun_03_jun_06/

They mentioned how people are materialistic and I guess I agree to a certain degree. However, they word it like *everyone* outside the church is.

I guess that‚Äôs where the attitude of some of these egotistic OWE come from.

The part with the story of the pastor and EVM.. I agree with the pastor but EVM implies that a good government is irrelevant. Easy to say because a good government would put down the INC more. I guess they prefer not having a good government to support their claims the world is not getting better. 

I timed the lesson from start to the hymns, 1 hour and 17 minutes I think. Adding the strange requirement to be there early makes it two hours. Mind numbingly boring lesson, egotistic and feels cherry picked and biased.

"Mid-week Worship Service Examination (Jun 07 - Jun 09, 2022)",v6wdhi,2022-06-07,"These comments have me looking forward to the WS to witness them causing controversy potentially among even OWEs.. basically one of those controversial lessons that helps people to think about what they‚Äôre hearing.

Five minutes in and I‚Äôm already zoning out but the lesson, like others say, regards family and related stuff. Controversially, abortion and telling people what to do. 

Interestingly, the minister preaching went off a bit about thanksgiving offerings demanding to know why people aren‚Äôt participating.. it wasn‚Äôt in a caring tone, more of an angry one. I‚Äôve noticed some tempers slip a bit lately, interesting to see. 

Long lesson and I couldn‚Äôt even bother to try listening for 5 seconds without my brain automatically focusing elsewhere. The constant ordering around, strict control and fear mongering is just old and annoying now. 

I wish they would teach positively instead. Like the benefits of obeying instead of the consequences. It‚Äôs just boring and repetitive. 

I notice they‚Äôre saying ‚Äúthis is what the church administration wants‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat does the church administration think‚Äù instead of God.. they may as well rebrand the church already, that‚Äôs all they have to do now. Change the name or something. 

Now the minister is descriptively talking about sexual safety measures or something. A middle aged filipino guy preaching it to a crowd that I can see is either uncomfortable or bored. I know the son of this minister, I feel bad for him. 

They‚Äôre claiming they‚Äôre not ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù.. yet they brag about themselves being ‚Äúbible scholars‚Äù though..? 

They‚Äôre still talking about the birth process (10 minutes now) and stuff of a child a little too descriptively. There‚Äôs children in the area too. Good thing I know from experience that I would just be zoning out or not understanding anything.

This is the weirdest WS I have gone through in a while I think.

2/10? Mind numbingly boring, more attempts of control over members lives and choices, and I can feel in the air that people were not comfortable. I saw a couple of people get up and walk out. Probably to the bathroom, but that doesn‚Äôt usually happen in the middle of a WS.

I GOT HOME AT 7:30. WHY IS IT SO LONG FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. IT DOESN'T END. Every new thing the minister talks about adds another 15 minutes to the lesson. IT IS LONGER THAN SEVERAL PPVS. Not to mention how awful the lesson actually was. I don't remember the earlier segments though I do remember some mentions of pregnancy and that wasn't good. Near the end, it became a lesson about PRAYERS. It was incoherent, messy, tedious, and all around awful. 

Even more sad is how the lineup can't save this garbage-fire. Most WS's are saved by their hymns (it's a me thing because I love the hymns). Like the one from last week. The lesson there  was pretty bad but the them singing 478, my favorite hymn, made it worth it. My thoughts on them are:

\-328 is not good (which is rare because they're pretty consistent with opening hymns)

\-56 is pretty good

\-116 is played too often (this is the only hymn that I'll give that complaint because other common hymns haven't been sung much this year).

\-443 is my favorite out of the lineup and would've made the WS actually worthwhile but IT WAS LITERALLY SUNG IN THE WS BEFORE SO WHAT'S THE POINT????  If they actually changed it to 442 then I might've accepted it.

\-344 is irrelevant

\-502, along with 56, are the only worthwhile things in the entirety of this WS.

But after these few lessons, I‚Äôm seriously thinking about leaving. Especially after the part where they said that its still a sin to abort a fetus that was a result of rape and that its forbidden for INC members.

I was molested by a minister at the age of 15.

If he ended up raping me and getting me pregnant, would the church have told me that the child was a blessing from something traumatic? Or would they tell me to get rid of it for the sake of saving face since it was a minister who committed the crime? This question has seriously made me question what I truly believe in. 

I have been thinking about leaving, but I‚Äôm scared. Like really scared. This has been my whole life, and it‚Äôs all that I know.

Sermon continued the topic of the creation of life. Per INC, humans don‚Äôt create life, but God does, so we hear more anti-abortion rhetoric. Again, I don‚Äôt know how this would fall under the Deadly Themes.

**Hymns**

Instead of all seven hymns, I‚Äôll just list two that stick out like a sore thumb:

* 271 = ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Remain in the Church, and Wait for Our Lord Christ‚Äù

Minister this WS talked about: 

- God
- Bible Stories
- Abortion is bad
- Lake of Fire
- Intensive renewal of life
- Salvation 
- The Administration
- Eduard V. Manalo 
- Abstaining from sex is bad

Talks about God at first then Adam and Eve. 

Then once again forbids the Calendar Method for no reason other than it's a sin. 

They then said talk about how Abortion is murder again (like they never [murdered](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AvuKS1Xi3iM) [anyone](https://politicsandchurch.wordpress.com/2011/04/08/some-iglesia-ni-cristo-members-are-murderers-and-hurts-other-people/) before) and how it can turn you into God's personal barbeque inside his holy eternal grill. Being raped is not an excuse apparently. 

Reads a verse which included being gay is bad but does not talk about it in detail. 

Minister said that ""INC doesn't impose their beliefs on other people"" when they have their own opinion but then claims that what they believe is the real truth...what he just did is called imposing his beliefs. 

The minister then ends the lesson by talking about the Administration and his significant other, Edwardo V. Manalo. 

Now let's all rise and pray for Eduardo once again cause he's totally above us all.

""Above us all, please bless Brother Eduardo V. Manalo""

"Weekend Worship Service Examination (Jun 10 - Jun 13, 2022)",v98eji,2022-06-10,"Lesson started about how people these days around us are ‚Äúungodly‚Äù‚Ä¶ they ought to look in a mirror sometime with all their hypocrisy and way of handling things. 

Oh hey, it says something about how God told (adam and eve?) some couple to multiply.. I see where this is going and there are children present. Not good. Whatever happened to keeping things PG? And now the minister keeps saying sex and descriptively describing processes‚Ä¶ 

this is like that weird uncle/relative at dinner who is unhinged and has no filter, except there‚Äôs no one to tell them off and take their medication/eat their food. 

I thought this lesson was gonna be different from other locales and be about how to be a good person while surrounded by bad people, but apparently now it‚Äôs just sex. I guess it‚Äôs a good refresher for health class, but this is not the place or time I would want to be hearing about this.

this is either like an unhinged unfiltered relative or something, no presence of mind for those present, no courtesy of holding back and I guess that‚Äôs brave, but not entirely respectable.

There is a thin line between bravery and stupidity, especially in this cult.

Now they‚Äôre talking about abstaining from sex is bad or something, apparently because satan can tempt or something. I kind of get what they‚Äôre saying, but why in the way they do? 

It‚Äôs somehow both funny and cringy how the minister keeps loudly and seriously emphasizing the word ‚Äúsex‚Äù.. 

Zoned out for the rest but I think they finally talked normally again (boring repetitive and the usual)

3/10? Entertaining but terrible how the minister kept talking about sex and processes and stuff descriptively and loudly, emphasizing the word sex or any word that has sex in it.. 

Oddly I want more of these controversial lessons so people will wake up and question what they‚Äôre hearing. Before recently, I don‚Äôt remember lessons like these.

Lesson was about: 

- Pray for absolutely everything!
- World is terrible
- Life is (naturally) hard
- God
- Bible story
- Family Hour 
- INC is growing

One of the things that I don't like about this lesson is how they said through a bible verse that we were born to suffer. This gives the INC admin all the justification they need to abuse their followers and work them to death for free.

They keep preaching all the bad things happening in the world while they themselves  are ones adding to those miseries by abusing their power. The world is not as bad as INC says but those Manalo believers are too blind and stupid to see that.

"Mid-week Worship Service Examination (Jun 21 - Jun 23, 2022)",vhe0pc,2022-06-21,"I would want to do morning WS but I don‚Äôt think I could do it every time. But the last time I did it I felt like I had all the time in the world and wanted to go travel somewhere or something, but with evening WS it‚Äôs always in the back of my mind, that I have that going on later on, but morning WS could be shorter. 

Before going in, I saw one of the head deacons and stared them down in the eye. There was almost no life in those eyes, no happiness, no determination, just like a robot whose only purpose is to recruit, obey, and be creepy. They couldn‚Äôt even meet my eyes.

Anyways, here‚Äôs some quick points I have for the WS.

- Doom and gloom, like life is terrible and happiness is gone (for them it probably is)

- Acts 20:28, something to do with Zion or something

- Minister kept asking us what church is the ‚Äúchosen‚Äù one in ‚Äúthese last days‚Äù

- It‚Äôs not enough to listen to the teachings because of course it‚Äôs not enough, said it‚Äôs not enough to be ‚Äújust a member‚Äù

- They say that you must also show fear of God which I kinda agree with, but then I don‚Äôt agree with them saying not to say no, that you *must* give in

- Romans 12:11 or something, only verse so far that I could actually catch other than their bread and butter Acts 20:28.. I wonder what was the reward of the person who found the lamsa translation..

- The minister is telling us that we should ‚Äòenjoy‚Äô worship services, how we should be excited or essentially *need* it. I can‚Äôt remember anyone, even any OWEs who look forward to worship services. Special ones maybe, like Thanksgiving or Holy Supper, but never worship services. 

- They boast again about them being strong and growing because they say God is on their side.. because they said so. 

- They try to reason all the recruiting and increasingly ridiculous goals as ‚Äúprogression‚Äù. Previous campaign results have not been good for them, and yet they push doubled number goals. Quantity over quality, and they don‚Äôt learn from previous mistakes. 

- Of course, they push for sharing faith. Here‚Äôs what seems to be mentioned every single WS. Obedience to EVM/church admin, doom and gloom, sharing faith/works of propagation, and there‚Äôs probably more that gets mentioned every single time. To the point where you could bet on it every time.

- They say you can share your faith through websites and videos. They had an idea where you could invite the people who were looking to be invited and I was actually almost on board right up until the moment they tripled the goal with a monkey-like smile. The eyes of the minister were darkened by the lighting angle so it looked cursed.  When one of my friends decided to check it out, they agreed when I told them it was cult propaganda. They immediately sensed it was off, just the website before even checking the videos.

- Apparently being an introvert is ‚Äújust a term‚Äù to these ministers. So if I say these ministers were robbed of their freedom, that‚Äôs just a term to them? They push aside the introvert/extrovert thing because it doesn‚Äôt benefit them in the sharing of faith. 

- This WS has unfortunately been stretched out. This minister keeps going off about propagation and sharing faith, but that‚Äôs expected because he keeps pushing after he probably got disciplined or something for not pushing it enough. He was once very cool, very chill, but now they only care about propagation, recruiting, and sharing faith. It‚Äôs sad how someone I thought could be different did not keep that. 

- I want garlic bread for some reason now. 

- Sharing faith guarantees a good future apparently..? Technically I‚Äôve already done that so I think I‚Äôm good. I‚Äôve brought more awareness that this church is a cult. I shared *my* faith, and they said to share our faith, and so I did.

Finally done, the WS that should‚Äôve been 30 minutes was stretched to 50, with the minister going off about the sharing faith. I can‚Äôt recall then going off about EVM though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/vhe0pc/midweek_worship_service_examination_jun_21_jun_23/

   * Tangent: If it truly were better not to have known, then why does INC insist on intensive propagation and not simply remaining silent? How sacred is INC‚Äôs cash cow?
* [Deuteronomy 31:11-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+31%3A11-13&version=NKJV)
* [Genesis 18:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Genesis%2018:19)
* [Proverbs 31:26-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+31%3A26-27&version=NKJV)
   * Here we see INC‚Äôs attempt to justify its ‚Äúmonitor your children‚Äù ~~coercion~~ ‚Äúinstruction.‚Äù Are they sure they‚Äôre not a cult?
* [Proverbs 22:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+22%3A6&version=NKJV)

INC proved its desperation with the hymns: 353 (‚ÄúWe Will Never Weary‚Äù) is basically nothing but obedience/submission; 356 (‚ÄúMy Loyalty to You Will Never Change‚Äù) does nothing to help matters. Sandwiched between those two, 378 (‚ÄúThe Sure and Strong Anchor for Our Lives‚Äù) includes the lyric, ‚ÄúNever straying from the true faith,‚Äù to keep the members trapped. Of course, the monthly singing of ‚ÄúI Am a Member of the CHURCH OF CHRIST‚Äù only adds to the üí©storm.

Here‚Äôs some points I noted:

- It‚Äôs apparently evil for someone in a household or family to be turned away/have a different faith or worship other gods, no wonder why OWEs can‚Äôt leave other people alone that easily

- Lots of bible stories used to justify obedience, like the Israelites or something. 

- The examples taught by the minister were all for justifying attending stuff like WS, bible studies, etc. 

- Now they‚Äôre transitioning into obedience and how it can implemented in households/families. I can see the excessive monitoring and strict instructions coming in now.

- ‚ÄúTeach our children by example‚Äù

- The minister talks about kids and their ‚Äúgadgets‚Äù like it‚Äôs a bad thing, much like a boomer may do. Ironically the minister is not. Seems like the brainwashing of the ministers turns them all to a similar age range, no matter how young they are.

Notes and points:

- Minister encourages us to place our full trust in God, seems decent but I feel like they‚Äôre going to rope in something that benefits them and burdens everyone else

- Minister indeed ties in the israelites and the church

- ‚ÄúKeeping holding firmly onto your hope in the promises of God‚Äù They seem to be talking about God in a more positive tone this time, rather than wrathful and fearful. I wish it would be more of the merciful and loving side, fear mongering just gets old and boring after some time.

- ‚ÄúWe should not worry‚Äù ‚ÄúPray to God‚Äù = ‚Äútrue characteristics of the children of God‚Äù or something

- Have faith (They keep repeating basics as if we are children.. there wouldn‚Äôt be much growth with repetition, they could try keeping things somewhat fresh so everyone would actually want to listen)

- ‚ÄúNothing is impossible with God‚Äù

- ‚ÄúGod hates doubt‚Äù - They went from uplifting to not so uplifting pretty quickly..

- ‚ÄúBear much fruit, the kind that *endures*‚Äù - I should start counting how many times they specifically say ‚Äúbear much fruit‚Äù, they seem to emphasize it all the same way. 

Seems like they miss the second part of that all the time because while they bear ‚Äòmuch‚Äô fruit, (assigning random people and forcing it) it does not endure. Most people I‚Äôve seen forced into offices leave at some point, or aren‚Äôt too happy doing it. Not exactly fruit, and not exactly fruit that endures, so why do they keep doing the same thing if it doesn‚Äôt work?

- The minister is saying that the time we use (free time?) should be used instead for worship service..? Maybe I misheard it. 

- ‚ÄúSet aside our offerings is a command from God. Let us not be offended‚Äù 

- ‚ÄúLet us share our faith‚Äù - They justify it by saying God will grant us whatever we want if we share our faith. 

- ‚ÄúLet us not spend all of our time in this world, we are ‚Äúpilgrims‚Äù here, our true home is in the holy city‚Äù  - Sounds or seems a little selfish to me‚Ä¶

- Apparently for our prayers to be answered according to the minister, ask God to ‚Äúlook down in pity‚Äù on us..

Last week, one of the deacons was sobbing uncontrollably. I thought it was because someone died in his family. Then I heard that his son got expelled from the church, and everything made sense. I don't know what he got expelled for. Maybe he was on this subreddit. Maybe he had a non-INC GF. This is just speculation considering his age.

"Weekend Worship Service Examination (Jul 01 - Jul 04, 2022)",vp1iuf,2022-07-01,"Not even a minute in, and abundant offerings have been mentioned with emphasis. The reason according to the minister is to give glory/praise to God. 

Points and Highlights:

- Many tie-ins of the offering and bible verses praising God, implications that our offerings are how we give thanks or glory, and potentially the more money the more glory. But it‚Äôs all going to the church admin.

- Acts 20:28 included

- I was able to sit towards the back and observe everyone, just about everyone had a bored or skeptical body language. Including the choir members and even some high ranking officers. Less than 5 or maybe 2-3 at least. were genuinely interested, but I only saw one seeming interested. At the most, 5 people genuinely interested. 

- ‚ÄúRedouble your efforts‚Äù - Justification for exploitation of free labor from the members

- Minister seems to have been pushing thanksgiving offering more lately. Like it‚Äôs a mandatory thing, not a voluntary thing. They even say ‚Äúvoluntary offering‚Äù sometimes. They frequently push for it, and say ‚Äúlet us participate‚Äù or something. 

- ‚ÄúGod loves a cheerful giver‚Äù - I have not seen anyone give offerings with a smile on their face. Maybe inside they‚Äôre smiling, but they don‚Äôt seem so cheerful. 

The justification for the abundant offerings seems to be that by giving offerings (our money that they keep asking we give to them), we are giving praise to God and are placing our trust in him. That it‚Äôs what a ‚Äúservant of God‚Äù would do, according to them. 

They also probably said that it‚Äôs to be ‚Äúunited with the church administration‚Äù.",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/vp1iuf/weekend_worship_service_examination_jul_01_jul_04/

- Attend WS
- Offerings (surprise surprise...)
- Propagation (their #1 favorite so far)
- Intensive renewal of life
- Pray for everything 

Wasn't sure if these are officially in the lesson but the minister talked about these ones too.

- Social Media against the church
- The Administration

This part where he told us to listen to what the church admin preaches and not what you see social media.

The most WTF moment for me was the minister telling us that we must still be ""sulong"" (offer more than last year's MYTG) despite the increasing prices of gas and stuff. 

How are we supposed to offer more with the prices of everything increasing you may ask. This is his advise...just pray for more money...yeah...that's it...good luck. Just make sure to give them abundant amount of money, that's what's really important.

The lesson came off to me as a bit boastful, justifying how the church is the ‚Äúone true church‚Äù. Plentiful elitist statements and reused stuff, and somehow the minister stretched the lesson out more than necessary, or I was just falling asleep. They seem to consistently push offerings though. Probably because the average amount of offerings is lowering. They push a little too much though, one minister even seemed a little mad once that people weren‚Äôt participating. 

They always say to give abundantly and cheerfully. Something that‚Äôs bothered me, and even my devoted family was the lack of info on where the offerings really go. I would like to know for sure where it really does, and I would like the other members to know where it goes too. We deserve to know where our money goes. No specifics and yet they push us all to give more.

These days, the average body language of the attendees (choir members, officers, members, guests) is a mix of boredom, skepticism, suspicion, or slight disappointment. Even the more active officers and even most of the high ranking ones look kind of bored too. Only the annoying OWEs differ, looking more lively. A little too lively.

"Mid-week Worship Service Examination (Jul 12 - Jul 14, 2022)",vxbxju,2022-07-12,"As usual, the emphasis of Worship Lesson is the July 27 INC Anniversary extortion of Thanksgiving monies from members through threats and use of Bible verses improperly used. When someone celebrates his/her own birth anniversary who does the preparation and serving the invited guests? It's the celebrator or his/her close family. Are the guests required to bring gifts? No. It is only voluntary and not mandatory. Does Manalo or family prepare and serve INC members for the Anniversary celebration? No. What kind of offering is required by God? Is it a money offering? No, it's not. It the offering of praise. (Ps 50:23)",https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/vxbxju/midweek_worship_service_examination_jul_12_jul_14/

"Mid-week Worship Service Examination (Jul 12 - Jul 14, 2022)",vxbxju,2022-07-12,"Somehow felt uninterested immediately instead of 1-2 minutes in..
Some points and notes:

- Minister says we must value our membership

- Justification and ‚Äúevidence‚Äù of how we are the chosen people or something

- Minister wants regular members to attend devotional prayers

- ‚ÄúWe must obey‚Äù

- ‚ÄúA true servant of God would obey all his commandments‚Äù

- ‚ÄúWe must prioritize our worship services to God above all else‚Äù

- ‚ÄúThe worship service is our appointment with God‚Äù  (so God isn‚Äôt with us as soon as we step foot outside the compound? )

- ‚ÄúWe must give offerings, let us not be offended for they are to praise God‚Äù 

- Side note, they mentioned earlier for officers to prepare for the year end thanksgiving.. we haven‚Äôt even had the mid year thanksgiving yet, I think they said to prepare our offerings and I don‚Äôt remember them saying to prepare ourselves. Seems a bit greedy focusing more on offerings than the state of someone. 

- ‚ÄúWe strive to be good examples to others, to be as lights of the world that is dark‚Äù (Good example of what not to be, that‚Äôs what.)

- Works of propagation shoutout about 30 minutes in, on point, on time, using the ‚Äúbranch bearing fruit‚Äù verse as an example as always

- ‚ÄúLet us be united with the church administration‚Äù  (Just go and say obey and never complain while you‚Äôre at it, that‚Äôs about the motto for INC now.)

- ‚ÄúWe may experience persecution for we uphold a righteous way of life‚Äù  (Where does it say that being toxic, manipulative, guilt tripping bastards is the equivalent of righteous?)

- ‚ÄúGod has sent the church administration; let us obey‚Äù

 - ‚ÄúTo not obey and follow God‚Äôs commandments is to waste our time‚Äù

- Colossians 9-11 (not entirely sure) : used to answer the question that *literally nobody* asked; ‚Äúwhat does the church administration do for us‚Äù

Always never enough inside this church.. they‚Äôll argue that one needs to ‚Äòprogress‚Äô even if no real progress has been made, they keep pushing even without results first

Points and highlights:

- Acts 20:28 used very quickly with the usual emphasis points (yelling loudly and extending the word (they unfortunately did this for the lesson a while back regarding pregnancy and specific terms)) 

-  Minister talks about renewing the mind of one‚Äôs self and life (something a lot of members need to do instead of staying in their toxic greedy mindset)

- ‚ÄúSatan controls those who disobey‚Äù 

- ‚ÄúEverything becomes renewed once you join the church of christ‚Äù 

- ‚ÄúThis world is unholy, unrighteous‚Äù 

- Minister talks down on trends, says we shouldn‚Äôt do them just because it‚Äôs popular, then eventual switch to obeying/uniting with EVM, then says how the devil will work hard to separate members from their membership (they would probably claim anything that opposes them to be of the devil..) 

- Minister goes off a bit on how we ‚Äò*must*‚Äô be active in activities, inviting guests, participation

- Minister justifies all the above, saying it is ‚Äúfollowing and obeying the commandments of God‚Äù.. 

- Minister pushes abundant offerings, saying we should not be offended, let us give ‚Äòcheerfully‚Äô
